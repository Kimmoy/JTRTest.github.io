It also implements station and certain other allowances.  The JTR has the force and effect of law for travelers, and implements statutory regulations and law for DoD civilian travelers. Organizations are expected to take appropriate disciplinary action when travelers willfully fail to follow the JTR.  However, unless stated otherwise in the JTR, the disciplinary action cannot be in the form of refusal to pay appropriate travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>The JTR applies to:</p><p></p><p>Uniformed Service Active and Reserve Component members and their dependents.  The Uniformed Services are the U.S. Army (USA), U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS).DoD civilian employees and their dependents.Other authorized travelers who use appropriated DoD funding, including new DoD Senior Executive Service appointees and certain Presidential appointees.DoD personal services contract employees.</p><p>The JTR does not apply to:</p><p></p><p>Contractor employees under a DoD contract for anything other than personal services.DoD employees appointed under 22 U.S.C. §2385(d).DoD civilian employees performing official assignments funded by a non-DoD Agency who are subject to that Agency’s travel and transportation policies.Government employees whose salaries are paid with non-appropriated funds (NAF) traveling on NAF business.Foreign personnel traveling under Security Assistance Management Manual authority.</p><p>Nothing in the JTR authorizes expenditures for purposes not provided for in Congressional appropriations or in law.  This publication is issued under the authority of DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 5 (Commercial Travel Management: PDTATAC).  Travelers and travel officials must adhere strictly to the JTR.  The traveler could be personally financially responsible for any expense accrued by not complying with the JTR.  When the General Services Administration’s Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) authorizes a discretionary travel and transportation allowance that the JTR does not address, the allowance is not authorized or implemented within the DoD. </p><p></p><p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JTR</p><p></p><p>The Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC) updates and publishes the JTR.  The PDTATAC is composed of a Chair and a member representing the Departments of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Commerce.  The Committee Chair is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy.</p><p></p><p>Each Uniformed Service has a representative on the Military Advisory Panel (MAP) and the Civilian Advisory Panel (CAP).  The MAP consists of a representative from each of the Uniformed Services. The CAP consists of a civilian representative from each of the Military Services and the OSD Washington Headquarters Services.  The MAP and CAP members report to senior leaders of the Uniformed Services, who serve as members of the PDTATAC.</p><p></p><p>EFFECTIVE DATE OF REGULATION CHANGES</p><p></p><p>A change to the JTR is effective, unless otherwise noted, on its first publication date.  This date appears in the lower left corner of each page.  When an effective date is different from the date of first publication, that effective date is indicated.</p><p></p><p>INTERPRETATION OF THESE REGULATIONS</p><p>AND THEIR UNDERLYING LAWS AND REGULATIONS</p><p></p><p>DoD certifying officer or disbursing officer may request an advance decision, in accordance with </p><p>DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy), on a claim whose validity or amount is questionable.  An Accountable Officer desiring an advance decision on an issue involving the interpretation of the JTR must forward the request for an advance decision through PDTATAC.  A traveler who disagrees with a decision by a certifying officer may submit an appeal or reclaim in accordance with DoDFMR, Vol. 9.&quot;</p><p></p><p>In cases of specific travel circumstances in need of clarification, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) (for a Service member), and the civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) (for a civilian employee) determine how the JTR, the Federal Travel Regulation (for civilian employees), and departmental instructions should be interpreted.</p><p></p><p>Decisions by the GC DoD, DOHA, CBCA (formerly called the General Services Board of Contract Appeals), and the U.S. Government Accountability Office provide guidance for similar cases or situations involving the same circumstances.  These decisions are referenced in the JTR, where applicable.</p><p></p><p>QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR RECOMMENDATIONS</p><p></p><p>Submitted questions concerning information in the JTR or suggestions for improvements or recommendations for changes must go through Command channels to the respective Service or Agency PDTATAC representative.</p><p></p><p>SERVICE OR DOD AGENCY REGULATION REVIEW PROCESS</p><p></p><p>Services or Agencies may issue related administrative procedures provided they do not conflict with or unnecessarily duplicate JTR provisions.  DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 5 (Commercial Travel Management: PDTATAC) requires that PDTATAC staff review all DoD written material that implements JTR provisions to ensure that per diem, travel, and transportation allowances, relocation allowances, and certain other allowances are uniformly applied.  The review process applies to all DoD Uniformed Services and DoD Agencies.  In addition, the USCG, NOAA, and USPHS may submit written material for review as desired.  A Service or Agency submitting written material to the PDTATAC must first send the document to its MAP or CAP representative.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1:  GENERAL POLICY</p><p></p><p>0101  BASIC TRAVEL RULES</p><p></p><p>This chapter outlines the basic information that applies to a traveler in any travel category.</p><p></p><p>010101.  Travel Categories</p><p></p><p>The categories of travel addressed in the JTR are:</p><p></p><p>A.  Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel.</p><p></p><p>B.  Government-funded Leave Travel.</p><p></p><p>C.  Local Travel at the Permanent Duty Station (PDS).</p><p></p><p>D.  Permanent Duty Travel (PDT), including Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel.</p><p></p><p>E.  Evacuation Travel.</p><p></p><p>010102.  Guiding Principle</p><p></p><p>The guiding principle behind the JTR is to travel responsibly.  The word “responsibly” means that the traveler exercises the same care in incurring expenses for Government travel that a prudent person would exercise if traveling at personal expense.</p><p></p><p>010103.  Traveler Responsibilities</p><p></p><p>A.  Financial Responsibility.  Traveling responsibly includes using the least expensive transportation mode, parking facilities, public transportation, or rental vehicle.  It also includes scheduling travel as early as possible to take advantage of discounted transportation rates.  The traveler is financially responsible for excess costs, circuitous routes, delays, or luxury accommodations that are unnecessary or unjustified.</p><p></p><p>B.  Items Not Mentioned.  If something is not stated in the JTR, it does not mean that an allowance exists or may be authorized.  The philosophy of “It doesn’t say I can’t; therefore, I can” does not apply to the JTR.  Instead, if the JTR does not say something can be reimbursed, then it cannot be reimbursed as a travel claim.</p><p></p><p>C.  Ethics Regulations and Rules.  The traveler must comply with Federal ethics laws, DoD 5500.07-R (Joint Ethics Regulation) and the Agency’s or Service’s ethics regulations and rules.  Rules pertaining to acceptance of travel and transportation benefits, including gifts, favors, and special accommodations from non-Federal sources must be followed.</p><p></p><p>010104.  Service or Agency Responsibilities</p><p></p><p>A.  Mission Controls.  Each Service or DoD Agency must authorize or approve only the travel necessary to accomplish the Government’s mission effectively and economically while establishing internal controls to ensure that only such travel is authorized.  An official responsible for directing travel or approving reimbursement is also responsible for ensuring that funds are used for official travel purposes and in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the JTR.  A statement must be included on the travel authorization specifying that alternate means, such as Secure Video-Teleconference or other Web-based communication are insufficient to accomplish travel objectives.</p><p></p><p>B.  Traveler Rights.  Unless stated otherwise in the JTR, the Service or Agency cannot reduce allowances or deny reimbursements because of limited DoD travel funds.  In addition, a Service or Agency cannot direct a traveler to travel at personal expense or at reimbursement rates or amounts inconsistent with the JTR.</p><p></p><p>0102  OTHER BASIC TRAVEL INFORMATION</p><p></p><p>The following information applies to all travelers, unless noted otherwise.</p><p></p><p>010201.  Key Participants</p><p></p><p>Official travel involves the participation of three key players: the traveler, authorizing or approving official, and the Travel Management Company (TMC).</p><p></p><p>A.  Travelers.  A traveler is anyone who travels on official business for DoD.  Travelers fall into three groups: Service members, civilian employees, and other travelers.  JTR allowances may differ among these groups due to law or other regulations.</p><p></p><p>Table 1-1.  JTR Travelers</p><p>(This Table is not All-Inclusive)</p><p>Uniformed Service Members</p><p>Civilian Employees</p><p>Other Travelers</p><p>1</p><p>Air Force</p><p>Civilians employed by the DoD</p><p>Spouse</p><p>2</p><p>Army</p><p>Civilians employed by other agencies, but funded by DoD</p><p>Children</p><p>3</p><p>Marine Corps</p><p></p><p>Other Dependents</p><p>4</p><p>Navy</p><p></p><p>Family members</p><p>5</p><p>U.S. Coast Guard</p><p></p><p>Relatives</p><p>6</p><p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</p><p></p><p>civilians not employed </p><p>by the Government</p><p>7</p><p>U.S. Public Health Service</p><p></p><p></p><p>8</p><p>Active and Reserve Component (RC) members</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>B.  Authorizing or Approving Official (AOs).  An AO determines whether travel is necessary and appropriate to the mission, ensures that all expenses claimed by the traveler are valid, and authorizes or approves the expenses if they are valid.  Expenses must not be approved if they are inflated, inaccurate, or higher than normal for similar services in the locality.  If the JTR indicates an expense, allowance, or other item must or may be authorized (such as the mode of transportation), it means the AO must give permission before the action takes place.  Likewise, if the JTR indicates “may or must be approved,” then the AO may or must give the traveler permission after the action takes place.  </p><p></p><p>C.  TMC.  The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for DoD travelers.  The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for travelers from other Federal agencies.  A GSA TMC may be used only when a DTMO-contracted TMC is not available.</p><p>1.  A DoD traveler must make travel arrangements through an electronic travel system when it is available or through the TMC if it is not available.  Any DoD traveler who cannot reach the TMC must contact the AO or designee for assistance.  However, lodging may be reserved outside the TMC when arranging for a large number of rooms in advance, such as for training courses, exercises, or conferences, or when safety, health, or security concerns require using specific lodging establishments.</p><p></p><p>2.  The TMC will book a traveler only for economy travel and economy accommodations.  However, a traveler may upgrade travel or accommodations at personal expense.  Under certain circumstances described in the JTR, other accommodations may be authorized or approved.</p><p></p><p>3.  A traveler, AO, or electronic system must provide the TMC a copy of the travel authorization before ticketing.  However, a TMC may issue tickets for official travel authorized by proper verbal, letter, or message authority if travel must begin or is performed before a written travel authorization issued.  The AO is responsible for providing a confirmatory travel authorization to the TMC.</p><p></p><p>010202.  Requirement to Travel</p><p></p><p>Travel is required when other means of conducting business, such as telephone calls or video teleconferencing, are unavailable or cannot meet the mission’s needs.  This must be certified in a statement on the travel authorization.  Government-funded travel and transportation are used only when officially justified and by the means that meet mission requirements consistent with good management.  </p><p></p><p>010203.  Travel Status</p><p></p><p>The travel authorization establishes when travel status starts and ends.  A traveler is authorized travel and transportation allowances only while in a travel status.  A travel status begins when a traveler leaves the PDS, residence, or office, or when the traveler detaches from or signs out of a unit or agency.  It ends when the traveler returns to the PDS, residence, or office, or when the traveler arrives at a new PDS by signing in with the new unit or agency.</p><p></p><p>A.  Travel Status Qualifiers.  A travel status includes:</p><p></p><p>1.  Time spent away from the PDS on public business under a valid travel authorization.</p><p></p><p>2.  Necessary TDY travel.  This includes time spent at a TDY location, regardless of whether duty is performed while traveling or how much time is spent away from the PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  PCS travel.</p><p></p><p>4.  Necessary delays while awaiting further transportation after travel status begins.</p><p></p><p>5.  Travel to or from a hospital or medical facility for observation or treatment.</p><p></p><p>6.  Travel by Government or other aircraft, including flights for training purposes made under a valid travel authorization that requires one or more landings away from the starting point.</p><p></p><p>7.  Flights for training purposes made in the absence of a travel authorization when it is necessary to remain away overnight.</p><p></p><p>8.  Other circumstances determined jointly by the Secretaries concerned before, during, or after an occurrence that constitutes a travel status.</p><p></p><p>B.  Alternate Departure Points.  A traveler may be authorized or approved to begin and end at the following places when it is to the Government’s advantage:</p><p></p><p>1.  Traveler’s residence when the traveler commutes from there daily to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Location at which the traveler maintains the family residence if it is not the residence from which the traveler commutes daily to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  Place near the traveler’s residence where the privately owned vehicle (POV) is garaged or stored.</p><p></p><p>C.  Travelers Other than Aircrew Member and Courier.  See Table 1-2 to determine when the travel status begins and ends for a traveler who is not an aircrew member or courier.</p><p></p><p>Table 1-2.  Travel Status Start and End Locations </p><p>for a Traveler Other Than Aircrew Member or Courier</p><p>Travel Status Start Locations</p><p>When a Service member departs from…</p><p>And proceeds to the…</p><p>And then to…</p><p>Travel Status starts </p><p>when the Service member departs from the…</p><p>1</p><p>home,</p><p>terminal,</p><p>N/A</p><p>home.*</p><p>2</p><p>home,</p><p>office, and performs duty there,**</p><p>the terminal.</p><p>office, even though the terminal is at the PDS.*** </p><p>3</p><p></p><p></p><p>another duty or departure point within the PDS before going to the terminal,***</p><p>other duty or departure point within the PDS.  A terminal is never “another departure point”.  </p><p>Travel Status End Locations</p><p>When a Service member returns </p><p>to the…</p><p>And proceeds to…</p><p>And then to…</p><p>Travel Status ends </p><p>when the Service member returns to the…</p><p>4</p><p>terminal,</p><p>home,</p><p>N/A</p><p>home.*</p><p>5</p><p></p><p>the office, and performs duty there, </p><p>home,</p><p>office.</p><p>6</p><p></p><p>another duty or arrival point within the PDS (a terminal is never “another arrival point”).  </p><p></p><p>other duty or arrival point within the PDS.***</p><p>    *The AO may permit the Service member to start or end official travel from the location at which the family residence is maintained if the Service member commutes daily to the PDS from a different location.  If to the Government’s advantage, the AO may authorize or approve POV use to start or end at one of the following: the Service member’s residence from which he or she commutes daily to the PDS; the location at which the Service member maintains the family residence, if he or she commutes daily to the PDS from a different location; the place near the Service member’s residence where the POV is garaged or stored.</p><p>  **Disregard travel to and from the office if the Service member performed no duty there.</p><p>***This does not prevent reimbursement of transportation between home and PDS on travel days.  See  Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>D.  Aircrew Member and Courier Status.  A Service member performing TDY as an aircrew member includes a Service member for whom aircrew duty is an additional duty.  It also includes an Armed Forces courier or other Service member whose primary duty makes the air terminal a regular duty place.  This does not apply to an RC member for first and last day when called to active duty.  Aircrew member status for an RC member only applies after the RC member arrives at the active duty location and terminates when the RC member departs upon relief from active duty.  See Table 1-4 to determine when the travel status begins and ends for an aircrew member or courier.</p><p></p><p>Table 1-4.

Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) and Advance of Funds</p><p></p><p>The Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) Regulations require a travel cardholder to use the Individually Billed Account (IBA) GTCC to pay for all authorized expenses relating to government travel.  The GTCC Regulations provide exceptions to mandatory use and when the conditions for withdrawing cash using the GTCC are authorized.  See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9, for travel advances when the traveler is not issued a GTCC.</p><p></p><p>010205.  Defense Travel System (DTS) Use</p><p></p><p>DoD travelers and AOs must use the DTS to process travel authorizations and vouchers for TDY travel and local travel.  A traveler must use the DTS to the maximum extent possible to arrange all en route transportation, rental cars, commercial lodging, and Government quarters when the DTS’s functionality is available.  See DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 3  (DTS).  The TMC processes reservations made in the DTS.  The Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD) programmed in the DTS on the date the voucher is approved for payment is used to calculate the official mileage.</p><p></p><p>010206.  Travel Authorizations and Orders</p><p></p><p>Travel and transportation allowances are payable only after valid orders are issued.  The order directs travel to, from, or between official points and serves as the basis for the trip and associated reimbursements.  A travel authorization or order should be issued before travel begins.  Travel or expenses incurred before a travel authorization or order is issued are not reimbursable, unless otherwise stated in the JTR.  In unusual or urgent situations when travel must begin before a written authorization  or order can be issued, a verbal authorization may be given.  In such cases, the verbal authorization must be followed up in writing (called a “confirmatory order”) before allowances are paid.  A travel order may only contain authority for travel and transportation allowances provided within the JTR.  If there is any conflict between a travel order and the JTR, the JTR prevails.</p><p></p><p>A.  Modifications after Travel.  Travel authorizations and orders cannot be retroactively modified to increase or decrease an allowance after the travel is completed.  A travel authorization or order may be retroactively corrected to show the original intent (CBCA 3472-RELO, September 23, 2013)).  When an allowance is approved after travel begins, it does not constitute a retroactive modification to create, change, or deny an allowance.  An amendment is effective on the date it is issued and is not retroactive unless it contains language that corrects an error or omission, or provides a confirmation of the date of the verbal authorization.</p><p></p><p>B.  Time Limits for Travel Authorizations and Orders.  See Table 1-6 for rules that define the time restrictions for travel allowances.  Requests for a TDY that exceeds 180 days at one location should be made in advance of travel to the authority identified in Table 1-7.  The requests must be made in writing and contain justification for the length of the TDY.  When the TDY exceeds 180 consecutive days without being authorized or approved, per diem stops on the 181st day.</p><p></p><p>Table 1-6.  Time Limits for Travel Orders</p><p>1</p><p>TDY Orders (Other Than Training)</p><p>A TDY at one location may not exceed 180 consecutive days except when authorized by the appropriate authority.*</p><p>2</p><p>TDY Orders for Training</p><p>Training courses for Service members that are scheduled to last 139 or fewer days (less than 20 weeks) are considered TDY.  If the scheduled duration is 140 or more days (20 weeks), then it is a permanent duty assignment.</p><p>3</p><p>PCS Orders</p><p>a.  Military PCS orders are valid for travel and transportation allowances to the new PDS named in that PCS order while the order remains in effect and before receipt of further PCS orders, unless otherwise specified in the JTR (see 45 Comp. Gen. 589 (1966)).</p><p>b.  Civilian PCS orders are valid for 1 year from the civilian employee’s transfer or appointment date.  See par. 053712 for exceptions.</p><p>*Bona fide assignment extensions that, when added to the originally authorized TDY period, total more than 180 days at one location, may be directed by the AO only when necessary for unforeseen changes or delays. </p><p></p><p>C.  Violation of 180-Day Rule.  Issuing a TDY order for 180, or fewer, consecutive days, followed by a brief return to the PDS and then another TDY order for return to the same location, is a violation of the 180-consecutive-day policy if the known, or reasonably anticipated, TDY duration exceeded 180 days when the initial order was issued.</p><p></p><p>Note:Exceeding the 180-day consecutive TDY time limit without authorization and approval does not constitute an automatic PCS.</p><p></p><p>Table 1-7.  Authorizing and Approval Authority for TDY of 181 or More Consecutive Days</p><p>1</p><p>All Service Members Other Than Army</p><p>a.  Secretary concerned, Chief of an appropriate bureau or the staff agency specifically designated for that purpose, or the Combatant Commander (CCDR) or Deputy CCDR.  </p><p>b.  No further delegation is authorized.  </p><p>2</p><p>Army Service Members</p><p>a.  Secretary concerned, Chief of an appropriate bureau or the staff agency specifically designated for that purpose, or the CCDR or Deputy CCDR.  </p><p>b.  This authority can be re-delegated to authorize a TDY for a Service member assigned to a Warrior in Transition Unit.  In that case, a Flag Officer or civilian equivalent from the U.S. Army Medical Command must first recommend that the Army Compensation Chief authorize or approve the TDY.  </p><p>c.  If the Army Compensation Chief approves the recommendation, then the Service Compensation Chief (a two-star Flag Officer or civilian equivalent) may authorize or approve the TDY.</p><p>3</p><p>Civilian Employees</p><p>a.  Secretary concerned, DoD Agency Director, Service or DoD Agency Headquarters (if delegated), Chief of an appropriate bureau or the staff agency specifically designated for that purpose, or the CCDR or Deputy CCDR.  </p><p>b.  This authority can only be delegated as stated for Service or DoD Agency Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>D.  TDY Travel Authorization or Order Issued Before Request to Exceed 180 Days Is Received</p><p></p><p>1.  If the mission does not permit obtaining the authorization to exceed 180 days before the order is issued, the travel authorization or order may be issued and the request submitted immediately to the appropriate authority listed above.  That authority must perform one of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Approve the authorization or order as written.</p><p></p><p>b.  Direct that the authorization or order be amended to:</p><p>(1)  End the duty and return the traveler to the PDS or assign a new PDS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Change the assignment from TDY to a PCS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Set the period at 180 or fewer days from the TDY report date.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Authorize a temporary change of station (TCS) if the traveler is a civilian employee and ensure that the tax information is listed in the remarks section of the TDY order for that civilian employee.  A TCS is a temporary relocation of a civilian employee to a new PDS on long-term assignment and subsequent return to the previous PDS after assignment completion.</p><p></p><p>2.  See Chapter 3, Part C for information on civilian employees deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq in support of ongoing contingency operations.</p><p></p><p>3.  For civilian employees, if a TDY will last between 6 months and 30 months, the AO must determine before the travel begins whether the assignment is actually temporary or should be a PCS.  If the assignment is determined to be temporary, the AO must then determine if the duty should be a TCS or a TDY.  For an assignment to be designated TDY, it must meet all of the following criteria:</p><p></p><p>a.  Duties are temporary in nature.</p><p></p><p>b.  Assignment is for a reasonable period of time.</p><p></p><p>c.  TDY costs are lower than round-trip TCS or PCS expenses.</p><p></p><p>4.  If the AO determines that a TCS is appropriate for the civilian employee, the civilian employee should see Chapter 5.</p><p></p><p>0103  FINANCIAL RULES</p><p></p><p>010301.  Receipt Requirements </p><p></p><p>A.  Retain Receipts.  Travelers are advised to retain ALL receipts for tax or other purposes.  DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy) dated June 2015, and DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 3  (DTS), require an itemized receipt for each lodging expense, regardless of the amount, and any individual expenditure of $75 or more.  AOs are discouraged from requiring additional receipts except to substantiate reimbursement if a traveler’s claim contains doubtful reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>B.  Lost Receipts.  If a receipt is impracticable to obtain or has been inadvertently lost or destroyed, a lost receipt statement explaining the circumstances and containing the same information as the lost receipt must be furnished.</p><p></p><p>Note:  A lost receipt statement cannot substitute for an online-booking hotel receipt.</p><p></p><p>010302.  Duplicate Payments and Fraudulent Claims</p><p></p><p>A.  Duplicate Payments.  A traveler cannot be reimbursed more than once for the same allowance or expense.  The Government does not pay expenses reimbursed, or to be reimbursed, by another entity.  The traveler must repay any such duplicate payments to the Government.</p><p>B.  Fraudulent Claims.  If a reasonable suspicion of a falsified expense for lodging, meals, or incidental expenses exists and the suspicion is identified before the traveler is reimbursed, the applicable per diem or AEA is denied for the entire day for which the suspected expense is claimed.  If there is reasonable suspicion of a falsified expense other than the cost of lodging, meals, or incidental expenses, the suspicious expense is denied.</p><p></p><p>0104  UNIQUE STATUS OR CONDITION</p><p></p><p>010401.  Absentee, Straggler, Deserter, or Service Member Without Funds</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member without funds is eligible for limited travel and transportation allowances.  This may be a Service member who is an Absentee and fails to go to the appointed place of duty at the time prescribed, a Straggler who becomes separated from the remainder of a party that is in a travel status on a party transportation ticket, or a Service Member Without Funds who must be at an assigned location, but has no money or means to get there.  A Service member who goes on leave without approval and remains absent from the unit, organization, or place of duty with the intent to remain away permanently (10 U.S.C. §885) is a Deserter.  A Deserter who surrenders at, or is apprehended and delivered to, a U.S. Installation other than the Service member’s PDS may be eligible for limited travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Necessary transportation and meal tickets, or the cash equivalent of meal tickets (see Table 2-17), must be furnished for travel to the new PDS or another place directed by proper authority when an Absentee, Straggler, Deserter, or Service Member Without Funds arrives at, or is delivered to, a U.S. Installation other than the Service member’s PDS and is without funds to purchase transportation.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement.  A Service member directed to use a specific mode of transportation is not authorized reimbursement if the traveler does not use the directed mode.</p><p></p><p>D.  Service Member Has a Prior Order.  Transportation and meal tickets, or the cash equivalent of meal tickets, are furnished in connection with the prior order.  See Chapter 5 if the Service member is traveling between the old and new PDS.  See par. 020305 if a Straggler is traveling on an order directing no or limited reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>Note:Follow regulations for Permanent Duty Travel to determine any potential reimbursement between the old and new assignment location.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 2:  STANDARD TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>0201 INTRODUCTION</p><p></p><p>Standard allowances are the core set of rules used to compensate a traveler for normal expenses incurred while in a travel status under an official travel authorization.  The information in this chapter applies to all travelers, unless noted otherwise.  It includes rules for traveling locally, shipping belongings, and qualifying for the three major types of standard travel and transportation allowances: transportation, per diem, and miscellaneous reimbursable expenses.</p><p></p><p>020101.  Transportation Allowance</p><p></p><p>The amount of reimbursement depends upon the type of transportation authorized or approved, the type of transportation available, and the type that the traveler actually uses.  Multiple transportation options are available to a traveler.  The Government will consider the needs of the traveler, the purpose of travel, the cost, and other factors and then do one of the following:</p><p></p><p>A.  Provide Government transportation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Purchase commercial transportation on behalf of the traveler.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimburse the traveler for personally purchased transportation.</p><p></p><p>D.  Reimburse the traveler for use of a privately owned vehicle (POV).</p><p></p><p>020102.  Per Diem Allowance (See Current Per Diem Rates)</p><p></p><p>The per diem allowance is a daily rate meant to cover living expenses.  It provides the maximum amount a traveler may be reimbursed for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses.  The per diem is based on the rate of the authorized stopover point or official duty location.  Only one per diem applies to a calendar day.  Expenditures defined in the JTR as “incidental expenses” are reimbursed at a defined rate, as part of the per diem allowance.  Incidental expenses are a separate category of reimbursement from “miscellaneous reimbursable expenses”.  The following list of standard incidental expenses applies to all travelers:</p><p></p><p>A.  Fees and tips paid to hotel employees, porters, baggage carriers, and flight attendants for all official domestic and foreign travel.</p><p></p><p>B.  Laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing of clothing only while outside the continental United States (OCONUS).</p><p></p><p>C.  Tax and service charges, other than vendor surcharges for using a credit card, for any of the expenses listed in this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>D.  Expenses related to lodging that are listed in the room account.</p><p></p><p>E.  Transportation tips for courtesy transportation (for example, an airport shuttle).</p><p></p><p>Note:For a traveler with disabilities or special needs, see par. 020207-D for relevant Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses.</p><p></p><p>020103.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses</p><p></p><p>Although miscellaneous reimbursable expenses are one of the three major types of standard travel and transportation allowances, they are discussed in this chapter often as part of either the transportation section or the per diem allowance section.  Miscellaneous expenses that are neither transportation-related nor per diem-related may require AO authorization or approval.  Section 0204 identifies those miscellaneous expenses not listed in sections or paragraphs that specify transportation or lodging reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>0202  TRANSPORTATION</p><p></p><p>This section addresses transportation to, from, and around official travel locations.  The AO should authorize transportation before a traveler departs.  If the AO does not, then air transportation is the authorized transportation mode for TDY and transoceanic travel unless the traveler demonstrates to the AO’s satisfaction that air transportation cannot meet the mission’s requirements efficiently or economically.  Each traveler is allowed a seat on the authorized transportation mode.  While an AO does not normally direct transportation, he or she may do so for a traveler under certain circumstances.  If travel changes unexpectedly, the transportation type can be approved after travel has begun if the reasons are acceptable to the AO.  Travel other than by a usually traveled route must be justified for any excess cost to be Government funded.</p><p></p><p>020201.  Traveler Does not Use Authorized Transportation or TDY is Canceled</p><p></p><p>A.  Traveler Does not Use Authorized Transportation.  If an AO authorizes a transportation mode for TDY travel that a traveler does not use, then the traveler is reimbursed for the transportation mode that has been used, up to the cost of the authorized mode, unless stated otherwise in the JTR.</p><p></p><p>B.  TDY Is Canceled.  If a TDY order is canceled while the traveler is en route to the TDY location, then round-trip standard travel and transportation allowances are authorized between the PDS location or residence and the point at which the cancellation notification was received (includes a leave point) and the PDS.  Allowances are limited to the cost of the round-trip travel distance between the PDS and the TDY location (see CBCA 2463-TRAV, November 11, 2011, and B-129607, November 21, 1956).</p><p></p><p>020202.  Excluded Hours</p><p></p><p>Normally, a traveler is not required to travel between the hours of 2400 and 0600 if it is not necessary for the mission.  The AO may authorize or approve a TDY rest point or an en route rest stop when the flight exceeds 14 hours, the travel is to or from a location OCONUS, and travel is by coach-class service.  When circumstances warrant, the AO must consider each case individually taking into account both funding and mission needs.  Rest stops may not exceed 24 hours.  Rules and allowances for rest stops during travel are in Table 2-1.  See Rest Stop Examples on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 2-1.  En route and TDY Point Rest Stops</p><p>Rest Stops at the TDY Point</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>When either:</p><p>a.  The scheduled flight exceeds 14 hours and travel is to or from a location OCONUS.</p><p>b.  The scheduled flight exceeds 14 hours, and travel is to or from a location OCONUS, the traveler is required to travel overnight (2400-0600) and the transportation mode does not provide adequate sleeping accommodations. </p><p>2</p><p>Not Authorized</p><p>When either of the following occur:</p><p>a.  The traveler is authorized first or business class travel.</p><p>b.  The traveler is provided a rest stop en route instead.</p><p>Rest Stops En Route</p><p>3</p><p>Authorized</p><p>When all of the following occur and the rest stop en route:</p><p>a.  Allows the traveler to start at, near, or after the end of the traveler’s regularly scheduled duty hours or during usual rest hours if the transportation mode does not provide adequate sleeping accommodations.</p><p>b.  Is at a location that is an intermediate point, and is near to midway in the journey as the authorized carrier schedule permits or if possible, at a location en route at which the carrier permits free stopovers.</p><p>c.  Is for a period limited to 24 hours, plus necessary time to obtain the earliest transportation to the authorized destination.</p><p>d.  Is because the origin or destination location is OCONUS and travel is by a usually traveled route.</p><p>e.  Involves a scheduled flight is over 14 hours by a usually traveled route.  A 14-hour period includes scheduled flight time, stopovers, and plane changes.  However, it does not include overnight time spent at airports.*</p><p>f.  Is necessary because the travel en route to the TDY site or upon return if the traveler cannot rest before returning to work.  This must be in the Government’s interest and is not automatic.</p><p>4</p><p>Not Authorized</p><p>When any of the following occur and rest stop en route:</p><p>a.  Is due to official travel for a permanent change of station (PCS), consecutive overseas tour (COT) leave, renewal agreement travel (RAT), emergency leave, Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R), Funded Environmental Morale Leave (FEML), and personnel evacuations.</p><p>b.  Is due to personal convenience when a traveler chooses to travel by a circuitous route, causing excess travel time.</p><p>c.  When a traveler takes leave at a stopover location.</p><p>d.  Is on return travel to PDS unless traveler is required to return to work without resting.</p><p>e.  For a traveler authorized first or business class accommodations.</p><p>f.  When the traveler is provided a rest period at the TDY point before reporting for duty.</p><p>*The flight length alone is not sufficient justification to authorize or approve an en route rest stop.  The TDY mission must be so unexpected that the traveler was unable to schedule a flight arriving the day prior to allow rest before work and the travel authorization must clearly state when the TDY travel was identified and when travel reservations were made.</p><p></p><p>020203.  Transportation Types Most Advantageous to the Government</p><p></p><p>A.  Preferred Transportation.  In the case of TDY travel, the following transportation types are presumed most advantageous to the Government, unless the AO determines otherwise.</p><p>1.  In accordance with DoDI 4500.57 (Transportation and Traffic Management), Government transportation by air for travel OCONUS is considered the most advantageous method when reasonably available to meet mission requirements.  See transportation computation example.</p><p></p><p>2.  When Government transportation is not directed, commercial travel by airplane, train, bus, or ship is generally the most advantageous method of transportation and should be selected when reasonably available.  Of these types, travel by airplane is usually preferable when available.</p><p></p><p>3.  When travel must be by automobile, a Government automobile is most advantageous.  If a Government automobile is not available, then:</p><p></p><p>a.  Consider a rental car.  See the DTMO Rental Car Agreement and DTR 4500.9-R, Part I (Passenger Movement), for instructions and guidance for rental car selection.</p><p></p><p>b.  A POV is considered most advantageous to the Government only after the other transportation types have been considered.</p><p></p><p>(1)  If the AO determines that using a Government automobile would be more expensive than using a POV because of unusual circumstances, then the AO may authorize reimbursement for POV use on TDY travel.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A traveler’s personal choice must not be the sole determining factor for authorization.</p><p></p><p>B.  Determination Factors.  The AO will use the following factors to determine which type of transportation is most advantageous to the Government for TDY travel: </p><p></p><p>1.

Availability of other transportation modes and the effect on productive time.</p><p></p><p>3.  TDY location in relation to traffic conditions, routing, and weather.</p><p></p><p>4.  TDY location in relation to the lodging, meal facilities, and transportation availability, other than a POV, between these points.</p><p></p><p>5.  Overall cost advantage when accompanying passengers in the same POV are also under official travel orders.</p><p></p><p>6.  Productive time lost due to additional travel time.</p><p></p><p>7.  Efficiency, economy, or other reasons favorable to POV use to accomplish the mission expeditiously.</p><p></p><p>8.  Unavailability of practicable commercial transportation.</p><p></p><p>9.  Delay to mission caused by the use of an airplane, train, bus, or ship.</p><p></p><p></p><p>020204.  Distance Determinations</p><p></p><p>A.  PCS and TDY Distance.  Distances are determined by using the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD).  It is the only official source for PCS and TDY distance information, including for personally procured moves.  If a facility or location is not listed, contact the website listed above.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Odometer Readings.  The DTOD does not apply to the following distances, which are determined by odometer readings:</p><p></p><p>1.  In and around the PDS or TDY sites.</p><p></p><p>2.  Between the home or office and the transportation terminal.</p><p></p><p>3.  For a Service member who travels a short distance for a move within the same city.</p><p></p><p>4.  For a civilian employee who transfers a short distance in accordance with par. 054802.</p><p></p><p>5.  Round-trip travel between home and the active-duty tour site for a Reserve Component (RC) member on active duty when he or she commutes. </p><p></p><p>C.  Privately Owned Air Transportation Distance.  See par. 020210.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Department of Defense (DoD) Travel Modernization Pilot Program Exemption.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Travel Modernization Pilot Program is exempt from using the DTOD and all mileage will be computed using a commercially-available mileage computation application.  TDY mileage (station to station) will be determined based on calculations from physical address to physical address, zip code to zip code, or city to city.  Local and terminal transportation mileage will be determined based on calculations from physical address to physical address or using odometer readings.</p><p></p><p>020205.  Separate Legs of Travel </p><p></p><p>Travel between any two official points listed in Table 2-2 is computed as a separate leg of travel.  If the trip involves more than one leg of travel, then each leg is computed separately.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-2.  Travel Between Any Two Official Points</p><p>1.  Actual residence</p><p>2.  Home of record</p><p>3.  Primary residence</p><p>4.  Privately owned vehicle-storage facility</p><p>5.  Location of last move home for a Senior Executive Service civilian employee</p><p>6.  Safe haven location</p><p>7.  COT leave location</p><p>  8.  TDY location</p><p>  9.  Renewal agreement travel leave location</p><p>10.  Permanent duty station</p><p>11.

Home of selection</p><p>20.  PLEAD</p><p></p><p>020206.  Airplane, Train, Ship, and Bus Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Missed or Canceled Travel Arrangements.  A traveler who misses or cancels travel arrangements must notify the Travel Management Company (TMC) as soon as possible to change travel arrangements.  A traveler must also notify the AO of such situations.  A traveler who is stranded while on official travel because arranged transportation was involuntarily canceled must contact the AO or supervisor for guidance concerning lodging or other arrangements.  Failure to follow these procedures may make a traveler financially liable for any resulting expenses.</p><p></p><p>B.  Lost or Stolen Tickets.  Lost tickets must be reported to the TMC.  A traveler remains financially responsible to the Government for the cost of the lost or stolen ticket, regardless of fault or negligence.  A traveler is responsible for purchasing a replacement ticket, and cannot be reimbursed for the replacement ticket until the Government has received a refund for the lost or stolen ticket.  If the initial ticket is recovered or turned in for refund, and the Government is repaid, reimbursement may be made to the traveler for the second ticket, limited to the cost of the first ticket.  See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy) for procedures on reporting stolen tickets.</p><p></p><p>C.  Unused Tickets.  All unused tickets, including a portion of a ticket, coupons, exchange orders, refund slips, airfare adjustment notices, and similar items and information relating to the unused transportation must be turned into the TMC.</p><p></p><p>D.  Replacement Transportation.  A traveler who lacks sufficient funds to purchase duplicate transportation may be furnished necessary transportation on a cost-charge basis in accordance with DoD Agency regulations (DTR 4500.9-R, Part I (Passenger Movement)) or Service regulations.</p><p></p><p>E.  Lost, Stolen, or Unused Government Transportation Request (GTR).  A traveler, or other accountable person, must safeguard a GTR at all times because he or she may be held liable for any Government expenditure caused through personal negligence in safeguarding the GTR.  If a GTR is lost, stolen, or unused, immediately notify the proper official, the named carrier, and other local carriers in accordance with Service or DoD Agency procedures and regulations.</p><p></p><p>F.  Lost, Delayed, or Damaged Accompanied Baggage.  A traveler may keep payments from commercial carriers for accompanied baggage that is lost, delayed, or damaged.  However, accepting the payment may affect any potential claim against the Government for the lost baggage.  A traveler who intends to file a claim against the Government for the baggage’s loss, delay, or damage should speak with a Government Claims Office before accepting a carrier’s compensation. </p><p></p><p>G.  Frequent-Flyer Miles or Other Promotional Benefits.  A traveler can keep any frequent-flyer points or miles, hotel rewards, or rental car upgrades accumulated during official travel, as long as those promotional items are available to the general public or to a class consisting of all civilian employees or Service members.  If a traveler voluntarily gives up a seat on an airplane, then the traveler is responsible for any additional costs incurred, such as additional lodging or meal expenses.  Also, a traveler cannot select specific flights or hotels to earn points if it will cost the Government additional money.</p><p></p><p>H.  Registered or Trusted Traveler Program.  Use of Government funds to obtain membership in registered or trusted traveler programs, such as Fly Clear, is statutorily prohibited (5 U.S.C. §5946  and GSA Bulletin FTR 08-05 (June 25, 2008)).</p><p></p><p>I.  U.S. Carriers Required.  The Fly America Act requires that U.S. flag carriers be used for all commercial transportation when the Government funds the travel (49 U.S.C. §40118(d)).  The TMC and AO, therefore, require that travel by air and ship be on a U.S. flag carrier for every leg of a trip, unless the TMC and AO provide supporting documentation that a U.S. flag carrier is not available.</p><p></p><p>1.  The Fly America Act does not mandate travel across the continental United States (CONUS) when traveling between two locations OCONUS.</p><p>2.  There is no transportation reimbursement, for any leg of a trip, when an unauthorized or unapproved non-U.S. flag air carrier service or foreign flag ship is used.  If a U.S. flag air carrier service or a U.S. flag ship is available for an entire trip and the traveler uses a non-U.S. flag air carrier or foreign flag ship for any part of the trip, the transportation cost on the non-U.S. flag air carrier or the foreign flag ship is not payable (FTR §301-10.143 and FTR §301-10.181).</p><p></p><p>3.  Documentation must be provided to the traveler to support all reasons when a non-U.S. flag air carrier is used in accordance with Service regulations.  The documentation should include the traveler’s name, non-U.S. flag air carrier used, flight number, origin, destination and en route points, dates, justification and the authorizing or approving official’s title, organization, and signature.  Endorsements on the order or Government-travel-procurement document, made in accordance with Service regulations, are acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-3.  Rules for U.S. Flag Carriers</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>U.S. Flag Air Carrier</p><p>1</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier is available, and the carrier performs the required commercial air transportation, and its use serves the mission,</p><p>a traveler must use the available U.S. flag air carrier.</p><p>2</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier is not reasonably available for the most direct point between two OCONUS locations,</p><p>use of a non-U.S. flag air carrier may be authorized or approved (GSBCA 16632-RELO, July 15, 2005).</p><p>3</p><p>a comparable or different kind of a non-U.S. flag air carrier costs less, or is preferred, by the Service or traveler, or considered more convenient,</p><p>a traveler must still use the available U.S flag air carrier.</p><p>4</p><p>the only U.S. flag air carrier available requires boarding or leaving the carrier between midnight and 6 a.m., or travel during those hours,</p><p>the U.S. flag air carrier must still be used if available.  The AO may authorize or approve the traveler a brief non work period, limited to 24 hours if the destination is other than the traveler’s PDS.</p><p>5</p><p>an indirect route is used for personal convenience and a U.S. flag carrier is available over the direct route,</p><p>a non-U.S flag air carrier may not be used.</p><p>6</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier offers nonstop, direct service with no aircraft change,</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier must be used unless such use would extend travel time including delay at origin, by 24 or more hours.</p><p>7</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier does not offer nonstop or direct service between origin and destination,</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier must be used on every flight segment in which it provides service unless, when compared to using a non-U.S. flag air carrier such use would result in one of the following:</p><p>a.  Increase the number of foreign location aircraft changes made by two or more.</p><p>b.  Extend travel time by 6 or more hours.</p><p>c.  Require a connect time of 4 or more hours at a foreign interchange point.</p><p>8</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier does not provide service on a particular flight segment,</p><p>a non-U.S. flag air carrier may be used, but only to the nearest interchange point on a usually traveled route to connect with a U.S. flag air carrier service.</p><p>9</p><p>a U.S. flag air carrier involuntarily reroutes a traveler on a non-U.S. flag air carrier,</p><p>a non-U.S. flag air carrier may be used.  If given  the choice to substitute service without delaying the travel, the traveler should select a U.S. flag air carrier. (59 Comp. Gen. 223 (1980)).</p><p>10</p><p>the AO determines that a US flag air carrier cannot provided needed air transportation or cannot accomplish the mission,</p><p>a non-U.S. flag air carrier may be used.</p><p></p><p>11</p><p>a non-U.S. Government source pays for transportation directly, or later reimburses by:</p><p>a.  A foreign government (for example, Foreign Military Sales funded with foreign customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits),</p><p>b.  An international agency,</p><p>c.  Another organization,</p><p></p><p>12</p><p>transportation is paid by a non-Federal source, in accordance with the JTR; DoD 5500.07-R (Joint Ethics Regulation); or Service regulations for non-DoD Services,</p><p></p><p>13</p><p>a non-U.S flag air carrier service would be 3 hours or less, and the U.S. flag carrier use would at least double the en route travel time,</p><p></p><p>14</p><p>medical reason including the need to reduce the number of connections and delays when transporting a person in need of treatment,</p><p></p><p>15</p><p>first-class accommodations are the only option on a U.S. flag air carrier, and less than first-class accommodations are available on a non-U.S. flag air carrier,</p><p></p><p>16</p><p>the transportation is provided under a bilateral or multilateral air agreement to which the U.S. Government and the Government of a foreign country are parties and the Department of Transportation has determined it meets the requirements of the Fly America Act,</p><p></p><p>17</p><p>a traveler’s safety is at risk, such as a terrorist threat against the traveler</p><p>the AO can authorize or approve a non-U.S. flag air carrier.  The risk must be supported by evidence.</p><p>18</p><p>the use of a U.S. flag air carrier would result in a delay to the traveler and involves more than 48 hours of additional per diem,</p><p>a non-U.S. flag air carrier can be used, if it reduces the delay (56 Comp. Gen. 216 (1977)).</p><p>19</p><p>the only U.S. flag air carrier service between foreign points requires travel between midnight and 6 a.m., to include boarding and exiting the carrier, and a non-U.S. flag air carrier does not require travel at during those hours,</p><p>a non-U.S. flag air carrier may be used to the nearest interchange point on a usually traveled route to connect with a U.S. flag air carrier.</p><p>U.S. Flag Ship</p><p>20</p><p>a U.S. flag ship cannot provide the transportation service required, </p><p>transportation may be obtained aboard a foreign flag ship. (B-190575, May 1, 1978).</p><p>21</p><p>a U. S. flag ship would seriously interfere with or prevent the performance of official business, </p><p>the AO may authorize or approve the use of a foreign flag ship.</p><p>22</p><p>a U. S. flag ship is not available,</p><p>the transportation or other appropriate officer may authorize or approve use of a foreign flag ship.</p><p>23</p><p>the request for foreign flag ship is for inconvenience in securing transportation on a U.S. flag ship, short delays in awaiting transportation, arranging circuitous routes for traveler convenience, or similar reasons.</p><p>a foreign flag ship may not be authorized or approved.</p><p></p><p>4.  When using code share flights involving non-U.S. flag air carrier, the U.S. flag air carrier flight number must be used on the ticket for the travel to qualify as having been on a U.S. flag air carrier.  If the non-U.S flag air carrier flight number is placed on the ticket then a non-availability document is needed.  49 U.S.C. §40118(d) permits the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to authorize their employees to travel by non-U.S. flag air carriers between two places in foreign areas even if U.S. flag air carriers are available.  This authority does not apply to Service members, civilian employees, or any of their dependents.</p><p></p><p>J.  Class of Service Used in Transportation.  A traveler must use economy or coach accommodations on an airplane, train, or ship.  However, the order-issuing AO may authorize travel on transportation that offers only premium-class service, such as Acela.</p><p></p><p>1.  Table 2-4 identifies other conditions under which a traveler can upgrade transportation accommodations.  A traveler experiencing extenuating or emergency circumstances may seek approval for an upgraded class of service from the appropriate authority within 7 days after travel is completed.  All other travelers must submit their requests in advance for accommodations at a higher class of service than economy or coach.</p><p></p><p>2.  Table 2-5 identifies who can authorize or approve premium-class accommodations.  Only a person senior to the traveler may authorize or approve an upgraded class of service.</p><p></p><p>3.  The flight length alone is insufficient justification to authorize or approve business-class travel.  The AO must first consider using economy or coach-class fare and scheduling the traveler to arrive the day before TDY begins to allow appropriate rest.  The second choice is to use economy or coach-class fare and arrange a rest stop, preferably at a no-cost point allowed by the airline with the traveler scheduled to arrive on the day TDY starts.  The last option is to use business-class accommodations with a scheduled arrival on the day TDY starts.</p><p></p><p>4.  Travel authorization for upgraded accommodations must be retained in accordance with Records Management procedures.</p><p></p><p>5.  A travel authorization must include:</p><p></p><p>a.  The cost difference between economy or coach class and the upgraded ticket.  See Decision Support Tools regarding premium class travel.</p><p></p><p>b.  The JTR paragraph number for the conditions that justify the change in class of service.</p><p></p><p>c.  A statement that the traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the transportation class for which the traveler was eligible and the cost of an upgraded class of service purchased if the accommodations are not approved after the fact.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-4.  Travelers Changing Class of Service</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>approved to use non-U.S. flag carrier and economy or coach accommodations do not meet adequate sanitation or health standards,</p><p>the traveler should request the AO to upgrade the class of service.</p><p>2</p><p>other transportation accommodations are not available and the AO identified in Table 2-5 determines that a premium-class upgrade or extra train fares are necessary for the mission after considering the TDY location, cost, and travel time,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve travelers to book first- or business-class airfare and extra train fares.</p><p>3</p><p>the traveler’s or Service’s needs require use of accommodations that do not meet minimum standards,</p><p>the traveler may voluntarily accept or use these accommodations and the Government may furnish them.  The Government cannot direct the traveler to accept inadequate accommodations. </p><p>4</p><p>accommodations that are usually more costly, such as business or first class, are offered at a lesser rate than unrestricted economy or coach,</p><p>the traveler may use the upgraded accommodations without obtaining special approval or authorization.</p><p>5</p><p>the AO determines the added cost of Economy Plus, Coach Elite Seating, or additional fee seating is in the Government’s interest,</p><p>the additional cost for seating in economy or coach class may be authorized or approved.</p><p>6</p><p>the AO determines the added cost of economy plus or coach elite airfare seating is necessary because less costly accommodations are inadequate for a traveler with a documented medical or special need,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve the traveler to use economy plus or coach elite airfare seating.  The AO may also authorize or approve economy plus or coach elite airfare for an attendant required to accompany the traveler en route (see par. 020206-K).  Only the authorities listed in Table 2-5 may authorize or approve other than coach or economy class seating for any transportation mode.</p><p>7</p><p>Government property or a traveler would be endangered using less costly accommodations, </p><p>more costly transportation at Government expense may be authorized or approved.</p><p>8</p><p>a protective detail accompanies a traveler who is authorized more costly accommodations,</p><p></p><p>9</p><p>a courier or control officer accompanies a controlled pouch or package when accommodations with adequate security are not available at a lower cost,</p><p></p><p>10</p><p>lower class accommodations are not reasonably available for departure within 24 hours of the traveler’s proposed arrival or departure times, or do not allow the traveler to arrive or depart in time to report for duty when scheduled,</p><p>the AO must justify putting business- or first-class transportation in the travel authorization by stating all of the following:</p><p>a.  When the TDY travel was identified.</p><p>b.  When travel reservations were made.</p><p>c.  The cost difference between economy or coach transportation and the business-class or first-class transportation selected.</p><p>11</p><p>a flight is scheduled to last longer than 14 hours during TDY and the origin or destination is OCONUS, the mission is so unexpected and urgent that it cannot be delayed or postponed, and a rest period cannot be scheduled en route or at the TDY site before starting work, </p><p></p><p>12</p><p>the following personnel are required for the mission:  </p><p>a.  Federal advisory committee members; </p><p>b.  Special high-level invited guests; and </p><p>c.  U.S. Armed Forces attachés accompanying foreign government minister traveling to the United States to consult with U.S. Federal Government officials.</p><p>the traveler may use business class if it is available and first class if not.  This is not applicable to NOAA.</p><p>13</p><p>a non-Federal source pays for business-class transportation in advance,</p><p>the travel authorization must state that the transportation has been paid by a non-Federal source.  See DoD 5500.07-R (Joint Ethics Regulation) and Service issuances.</p><p>14</p><p>a non-Federal source pays for first-class transportation in advance, and at least one of the other circumstances in this table for first-class travel is also met,</p><p></p><p>15</p><p>using business class results in overall savings to the Government by eliminating overtime, additional subsistence costs, or lost productivity time, </p><p>a cost comparison must be stated on the travel authorization.</p><p>16</p><p>foreign-government personnel are traveling in the Government’s interest and the traveler’s country has regulations, a memorandum of understanding, a memorandum of agreement, or a status of forces agreement that requires business or first-class accommodations,</p><p>the traveler is authorized business- or first-class transportation.</p><p>17</p><p>an en route stopover is an overnight stay and an en route rest stop is authorized or an overnight rest period occurs at the TDY location before beginning work,</p><p>business class is not allowed.</p><p></p><p>K.  Medical or Special Needs.  Any accommodation for a medical or special need requires that a medical authority provides a written certification of the medical condition or special need.  An AO should also consider physical characteristics when determining the class of travel and the options for accommodating those special needs.  Consider other travel options such as reserving economy plus, coach elite seating, or bulkhead seating that provide extra leg room or purchase two coach seats before recommending premium class travel.  Only the authorities listed in Table 2-5 may authorize or approve premium class travel.  If the traveler requires an attendant or escort, see Table 2-4, for criteria to authorize or approve premium-class accommodations for the attendant.  Authority to use upgraded accommodations is limited to the disabled or special needs traveler and their attendant, and does not permit the rest of the family to travel on a class of service other than economy or coach.  A medical authority must recertify the traveler’s medical condition or special need in writing:</p><p></p><p>1.  Every six months for a temporary condition.</p><p></p><p>2.  Every two years for a lifelong condition.</p><p>Table 2-5.

Not Authorized.  Unless authorized or approved for medical reasons or physical handicap in accordance with the par. 020206-K upgraded accommodations are not authorized for the types of travel listed in Table 2-6.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-6.

RAT</p><p></p><p>M.  Commercial Air Transportation.  Commercial airplane is the preferred mode for official travel more than 400 miles one way  or more than 800 miles round trip. </p><p></p><p>1.  General Services Administration (GSA) City Pair Program Fares</p><p></p><p>a.  The GSA City Pair Program is a contract between the Government and certain airlines for routes frequently traveled for Government business.  The program requires a traveler to use these routes when they are available.  City Pair Program fares are for official travel only and cannot be used for travel to or from leave points or for any portion of a route traveled for personal convenience.  For details see the GSA City Pair Program; DoD 4500.9-R, Part 1 (Passenger Movement); the FTR §301-10, and city pair program computation example.  City Pair Program flights are identified by the fare basis codes of either “YCA” or “-CA.”</p><p></p><p>(1)  YCA refers to a contracted, unrestricted coach-class fare that includes the benefit of last-seat availability.  As long as a seat is available on the airplane, the Government traveler may purchase the seat at the YCA airfare.</p><p></p><p>(2)  -CA refers to a contracted, unrestricted coach-class fare that is capacity controlled.  Only a certain number of seats are available on a given flight at the -CA rate.  A -CA airfare should be used when available and only the YCA should be used for cost comparison.</p><p></p><p>b.  A command cannot permit a TMC to purchase YCA airfare when a -CA airfare is available and the AO determines that a -CA airfare meets the mission’s needs.  Personal frequent flyer points or miles use is not a valid reason to request a YCA airfare when a –CA fare is available.  A traveler who elects to use a YCA airfare when a –CA airfare is available, in order to use points or miles, is financially responsible to the Government for the cost difference between the YCA airfare and the –CA airfare (CBCA 1511-TRAV, May 7, 2009).</p><p></p><p>2.  Restricted Airfares.  The AO may authorize or approve restricted airfares when they are offered to the general public and if trip cancellation would not impose significant costs.  </p><p></p><p>a.  When a City Pair Program fare is available, the AO must use the Restricted Airfares Checklist when considering the approval of restricted airfares.  Restricted airfares cannot be applied in a blanket fashion, but can be considered for each trip on an individual basis.  For City Pair Program routes, if the contract carrier offers a lower fare, the traveler must use that airline’s restricted fare before selecting another airline’s restricted economy or coach airfare.  </p><p></p><p>b.  When a City Pair Program Fare is not available, the traveler should use the lowest cost coach-class fare that meets mission requirements </p><p></p><p>c.  The AO must consider that if a restricted fare is authorized and then later canceled or changed for official reasons and not for the personal convenience of the traveler, the Government is responsible for any excess costs.</p><p></p><p>Note:  When a restricted airline ticket is changed or canceled, any remaining value may only be used for future official travel.  Under no circumstances may the traveler pay any penalty and then use the ticket or partial credit for personal travel.</p><p></p><p>3.  Involuntarily Denied Flight Boarding.  A traveler who is involuntarily denied boarding on a flight must contact the TMC to book a new flight if a subsequent flight cannot be provided without additional cost to the Government.  Any compensation for the denied seat belongs to the Government (59 Comp. Gen. 203 (1980)).  The traveler must request that the carrier show the “Treasurer of the United States” as payee on the compensation check, in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 2-7.  Transportation Allowances for Commercial Air Travel</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>no written policy specifies which airport to use and multiple airports in the same area are available for use,</p><p>the traveler may select which airport to use.  A traveler can only be required to use a specific airport when the command or installation has a written policy that requires using it because it is economical.</p><p>2</p><p>local written policies do not permit a traveler to select which of multiple airports in the same area to use,</p><p>the traveler must follow the local written policy in selecting an airport.</p><p>3</p><p>a traveler is unable to travel by air due to a medical condition or genuine fear of flying that would result in a serious physical or psychological reaction, </p><p>the AO may authorize an alternate type of transportation after receiving a medical authority’s written certification that the condition or fear prevents travel by air.</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler must change airlines to get to a destination and one or both airlines do not interline baggage, </p><p>the traveler can use a different airline, even if it is more expensive, unless he or she is booked on an AMC Patriot Express flight.  Regardless of the airline, the traveler must follow the Fly America Act.</p><p></p><p>N.  Train, Ship, or Bus Transportation.  For trains and buses, use the discount fares offered to the Government when the transportation meets mission requirements.  Travel by ship may be authorized or approved.  Only the authorities in Table 2-5 may authorize or approve other than coach or economy class accommodations  under the following circumstances (OMB Bulletin 93-11, April 19, 1993 (Fiscal Responsibility and Reducing Perquisites)):</p><p></p><p>1.  The travel can be completed only by ship.</p><p></p><p>2.  The travel is performed more economically or efficiently by ship.</p><p></p><p>3.  The travel is for medical reasons.</p><p></p><p>4.  The travel is for security reasons.</p><p></p><p>5.  The Secretarial Process authorizes or approves the travel as being advantageous to the Government for travel OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>020207.  Reimbursement for Commercial Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Commercial Air, Train, Ship, or Bus Transportation.  A traveler is reimbursed the authorized or approved transportation cost, which includes the fare and the TMC fee.  If a traveler uses Government-procured transportation for part of a leg of travel, reimbursement to a traveler must be reduced by the cost of the Government-procured transportation.  However, advanced seat assignment and additional-fee seating is a personal choice.  Any fee incurred for changing the seat assignment is not reimbursed unless it is in the Government’s interest, such as would be the case for an eligible traveler with a medical or special need.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transoceanic Ship Travel.  Reimbursement for a traveler who uses unauthorized or unapproved transoceanic ship travel is limited to the policy-constructed cost.  The policy-constructed cost is the sum of the transportation cost and the TMC fee that the Government would have incurred if travel had been performed using the authorized transportation type.</p><p></p><p>C.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses Associated with Commercial Air, Train, Ship, or Bus.  Commercial air, train, ship, or bus reimbursable transportation expenses consist of:</p><p></p><p>1.  Fees for the first checked bag.  Any additional cost because of size or weight must be authorized or approved.</p><p></p><p>2.  Excess accompanied baggage when it is authorized or approved.  To be authorized or approved, the contents of the baggage must be required for the traveler’s official duty and must not be available at the TDY location.  See Chapter 5 for allowances related to unaccompanied baggage.</p><p></p><p>3.  Accompanied baggage that goes to the original destination on an unused portion of a ticket after the traveler prematurely leaves the carrier if the traveler provides a full explanation of facts that is acceptable to the Transportation Officer or AO.</p><p></p><p>4.  Expedited return to the travel origination point of accompanied baggage from which a Service member or civilian employee has become separated during a troop movement, when authorized or approved in accordance with Service regulations.</p><p></p><p>5.  The extra cost of a paper ticket add-on fee when authorized or approved as necessary and documented, such as an airline work stoppage.</p><p></p><p>6.  One-way mileage, at the TDY mileage rate, from home or place of duty to a transportation terminal for each way, or round-trip mileage if being dropped off or picked up, when a traveler uses a POV.</p><p></p><p>7.  Ground transportation between interim terminals when traveling on official business.</p><p></p><p>8.  In-flight internet connections are not reimbursable unless authorized or approved and determined they are used to perform official business.</p><p></p><p>9.  Arrival or departure taxes or fees that are charged for entry or exit from a foreign country may be reimbursed if the traveler incurs the expense directly, rather than including in the transportation ticket cost. </p><p></p><p>10.A mandatory unaccompanied minor fee that an airline charges for a child traveling alone due to official orders.  Reimbursement of the unaccompanied minor fee is not authorized when the child travels alone for member’s convenience.</p><p></p><p>D.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses for Travelers with Medical or Special Needs.  A traveler with medical or special needs may receive reimbursement for the following additional transportation-related miscellaneous costs:</p><p></p><p>1.  Specialized services provided by a commercial carrier that are necessary to accommodate the traveler’s disability or special need, such as specialized transportation to, from, or at a TDY location.</p><p></p><p>2.  The cost of renting or transporting specialized equipment, such as a wheelchair, needed in transit or at the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>3.  Baggage check-in fee at curbside.</p><p>4.  Baggage handling tips for a traveler with a disability.</p><p></p><p>E.  Reimbursement When a TMC Is Available but Not Used.  When a TMC is available but not used by a traveler, reimbursement for transportation costs is limited to the amount that the Government would have paid if the arrangements had been made directly through a TMC.  Transaction fees are not reimbursable, as it should be extremely rare that a TMC is not available.</p><p></p><p>F.  Reimbursement When a TMC Is Not Available.  When the AO certifies that a TMC is not available to arrange the required official transportation, the traveler receives reimbursement for the actual authorized or approved transportation costs, including the transaction fee.  The total transportation reimbursement must not exceed the policy-constructed fare that meets mission requirements.</p><p></p><p>020208.  Reimbursement for Government Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Reimbursement for Government Plane, Ship, or Bus.  An AO may direct a traveler to use Government transportation, such as a plane, ship, or bus over a usually traveled route (see transportation computation example).  When a traveler does not use the directed mode, reimbursement is not allowed.  A traveler is not ordinarily charged for baggage expenses when using Government transportation.  The AO must authorize or approve any charges for excess accompanied baggage.</p><p></p><p>B.  Government Automobile.  An AO may direct a traveler to use a Government automobile when taking an airplane, train, bus, or ship is not advantageous to the Government.  In these cases, the traveler must use a Government automobile, if one is available.  If an AO determines a Government automobile would be more expensive than a POV, then the AO may authorize a POV.  See Table 2-9 for information about the circumstances under which a Government automobile is directed but a POV is used instead.</p><p></p><p>Note:  A Government automobile is limited to official purposes, including transportation to and from duty sites, lodgings, dining facilities, drugstores, barber shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and similar places required for the traveler’s subsistence, health, or comfort.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement for Use of a Government Automobile.  A traveler using a Government automobile may receive reimbursement for:</p><p>1.  Gas and oil.</p><p></p><p>2.  Ferry fares, storage fees, guard fees, and repairs.</p><p></p><p>3.  Bridge, road, or tunnel tolls.</p><p></p><p>4.  Parking fees when the AO authorizes or approves them.</p><p></p><p>5.  Insurance to cover liability for damage, personal injury, or death to third parties when traveling in foreign locations where law requires the insurance coverage.</p><p></p><p>6.  The cost of an international driver’s license, including the cost of photos, when mission essential.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>020209.  Rental Vehicle</p><p></p><p>A.  Obtaining Authorization.  To be reimbursed, an AO must authorize or approve use of a rental vehicle.  A traveler must obtain a rental vehicle through an electronic system when it is available or through the TMC if it is not available.  TMC use is not mandatory when renting an airplane or bus (CBCA 2956-TRAV, January 31, 2013).  A compact vehicle is the standard size for official travel, but the AO may authorize or approve a larger vehicle for the following reasons: </p><p></p><p>1.  Medical disability or other special need.</p><p></p><p>2.  Mission requirements.</p><p></p><p>3.  Cost is the same or less for a non-compact vehicle.</p><p></p><p>4.  Multiple travelers are authorized to travel in the same rental vehicle.</p><p></p><p>5.  Government material for official business requires more space.</p><p></p><p>6.  Safety, such as driving during severe weather or on rough or difficult terrain.</p><p></p><p>B.  Reimbursement for Use of a Rental Vehicle.  A traveler is reimbursed the cost of the authorized or approved rental vehicle.  This includes the related taxes and local assessments added into the rental agreement.  Fees associated with rental car loyalty points and the transfer of points are not reimbursed.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement for Rental Vehicle Insurance.  The Government is self-insured.  A traveler should verify that a rental vehicle is part of the U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement, which provides full insurance coverage.  The traveler is reimbursed optional insurance on a rental only when traveling in foreign areas where insurance is required by law or when traveling for certain classified special operations in the CONUS or non-foreign areas OCONUS.  For these classified special operations, the AO must specifically approve the insurance reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-8.  Rental Vehicle Expenses</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a traveler does not obtain the rental vehicle through a TMC, </p><p>reimbursement is limited to what the rental vehicle would have cost if it had been obtained through a TMC.</p><p>2</p><p>the AO did not authorize or approve the rental vehicle for en route travel to or from the TDY location,</p><p>the traveler may be reimbursed the TDY mileage rate as if traveling by POV.  The TDY mileage-rate reimbursement is limited to the mode of transportation authorized.</p><p>3</p><p>multiple travelers go to one location,</p><p>only the traveler booking the rental vehicle may claim expenses associated with its use.</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler cannot refuel completely before returning the vehicle because of safety issues or the location of the closest fueling station, </p><p>the rental vehicle company’s charges to refuel the vehicle may be approved for reimbursement.</p><p>5</p><p>a daily administrative fee is charged due to the   U.S. Government Rental Car Agreement, which includes a Government administrative rate supplement (GARS), </p><p>the traveler may receive reimbursement for the daily administrative fee.</p><p>6</p><p>the mission requires an international driver’s license,</p><p>the traveler may be reimbursed the cost of obtaining it, including the cost of the photos.</p><p>7</p><p>a breathalyzer is required in a foreign country and the traveler returns it unused,</p><p>the breathalyzer fee is reimbursable.</p><p>8</p><p>a breathalyzer is required in a foreign country and it is used,</p><p>the breathalyzer fee is reimbursable if a foreign authority directed the driver to use it and the device shows that the driver was not impaired.</p><p>9</p><p></p><p>the breathalyzer fee is not reimbursable if the breathalyzer was used for personal convenience or while not on official travel, or if a foreign authority directed the driver to use it and the device showed the driver was impaired.</p><p>10</p><p>non-standard equipment, such as snow tires, is necessary,</p><p>fees for the upgrade are reimbursable if the equipment is part of the rental agreement; however, equipment purchased separately from the rental vehicle agreement is not reimbursable.</p><p>11</p><p>the AO determines that use of a one-way rental is advantageous to the Government,</p><p>the drop-off fee may be reimbursed.</p><p>12</p><p>the AO determines that a rental vehicle dropped off at an alternate location is advantageous to the Government,</p><p></p><p>13</p><p>the AO authorizes or approves a global-positioning system,</p><p>the traveler may receive reimbursement.</p><p>14</p><p>a traveler incurs gas or oil expenses,</p><p>the traveler may receive reimbursement.</p><p>Note:  Prepaid fueling is not authorized.</p><p>15</p><p>the AO authorizes or approves ferry fares; bridge, road, and tunnel tolls; and parking fees,</p><p>the traveler may receive reimbursement; however, an administrative fee associated with failing to pay a toll is not reimbursable.</p><p> </p><p>16</p><p>the AO authorizes or approves use of a toll-collection transponder when necessary for official use,</p><p></p><p>17</p><p>the traveler pays for access fees, for example, additional fees for access to an airport location,</p><p></p><p></p><p>D.  Reimbursement for Rental Vehicle Damage.  A DoD traveler may be reimbursed for personal funds paid to a rental car company for rental vehicle damage sustained in the performance of official business if the claim is adjudicated payable.  See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9, Chapter 4 (Transportation Allowances); DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 10, Chapter 12 (Miscellaneous Payments); and the DoD Guidebook for Miscellaneous Payment for information on how to request reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>1.  The Government may make direct payment to the rental car company, instead of the traveler, if appropriate.  Requests for payment must be accompanied by supporting documentation, ordinarily statements, itemized bills, and an accident report (see DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy), for details).  A DoD traveler may file accident reports on the DTMO website if the damaged vehicle is covered under the DTMO Rental Car Agreement.</p><p></p><p>2.  A non-DoD traveler who rents a vehicle pursuant to a valid DoD-funded travel authorization must follow written Service or DoD Component guidance in documenting and filing a claim for vehicle damage.</p><p>Note:  See DTMO Rental Car Agreement, and DTR 4500.9-R, Part I (Passenger Movement) for further instructions and guidance for the rental vehicle selection.  A rental vehicle is limited to official purposes, including transportation to and from duty sites, lodgings, dining facilities, drugstores, barber shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and similar places required for the traveler’s subsistence, health, or comfort.  </p><p></p><p>020210.  Privately Owned Vehicles (POV)</p><p></p><p>A traveler cannot be directed to use a POV for official travel or be a passenger in another TDY traveler’s POV(53 Comp. Gen 67 (1973)).  If a traveler chooses to use a POV, then the amount of the potential reimbursement depends on whether using the vehicle is more advantageous to the Government than other modes of transportation.  If using a POV is not advantageous to the Government, then no miscellaneous reimbursable expenses associated with driving a POV are reimbursed (see mileage rates).  When computing TDY mileage reimbursement, do not round the result to the nearest dollar.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Charges related to repairs, depreciation, maintenance, towing, and other similar expenses for a POV are not reimbursable through the travel voucher process.  Service members may seek reimbursement by following procedures in DoDI 1340.21 (Settling Personnel and General Claims and Processing Advance Decision Requests).  Civilian employees may seek reimbursement by using Service procedures and referencing the Personnel Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §3721).</p><p></p><p>Table 2-9.  General Rules when Using a POV</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a TDY traveler picks up or drops off other official passengers at home,</p><p>the traveler claiming the mileage may claim reimbursement for the extra distance based on odometer readings or other acceptable evidence.</p><p>2</p><p>a traveler is directed to use a Government automobile with other travelers, but instead uses a POV,</p><p>mileage reimbursement is not authorized if the Government automobile makes the trip.</p><p>3</p><p>a traveler uses a POV instead of an authorized (but not directed) and available Government vehicle,</p><p>the traveler is limited to reimbursement at a POV other mileage rate for the official distance.  Reimbursable expenses associated with driving a POV and incurred during travel between the PDS and a TDY location are not authorized.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Reimbursement for Privately Owned Automobiles or Motorcycles.  The TDY mileage rate is different for automobiles, motorcycles, and airplanes.  A self-propelled mobile home is paid at the automobile mileage rate.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-10.  Reimbursement for Privately Owned Automobiles and Motorcycles</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>the official distance between authorized locations (as determined by the DTOD* or from appropriate distances (non DoD Services)) is 400 miles or less one way or 800 miles or less round trip,</p><p>use of a private automobile or motorcycle is considered advantageous to the Government.  The traveler is reimbursed the appropriate cents per mile for the DTOD* distance between official points.  No cost comparison is required.</p><p>2</p><p>the official distance between authorized locations (as determined by the DTOD*) is greater than 400 miles one way, or greater than 800 miles round trip, </p><p>the AO may authorize or approve the use of a private automobile or motorcycle on a case-by-case basis in accordance with guidance if advantageous to the Government. </p><p>3</p><p>a traveler uses a POV instead of the authorized transportation type (other than a Government automobile),</p><p>reimbursement is limited to the constructed cost of the authorized transportation type.  Miscellaneous reimbursable expenses associated with driving a POV and incurred during travel, such as parking and tolls, are not authorized for reimbursement.</p><p>4</p><p>an official traveler is a passenger in an automobile or on a motorcycle,</p><p>the passenger is not authorized reimbursement for transportation, but may receive per diem. </p><p>*See Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD) for official mileage)</p><p></p><p>B.  Reimbursement for Privately Owned Airplanes.  A traveler is reimbursed mileage based on aeronautical charts when an AO determines that using a privately owned airplane is more advantageous to the Government than using other transportation modes.</p><p></p><p>1.  If a traveler cannot determine the distance by aeronautical charts, then he or she must determine it by multiplying the flight time by the aircraft’s cruising speed.  Additionally, the traveler may receive reimbursement for landing, parking, and tie-down fees.</p><p></p><p>2.  If a traveler uses an airplane provided by an Aero Club, then allowable expenses include:</p><p></p><p>a.  The hourly fee imposed by the Aero Club.</p><p></p><p>b.  Fuel charges if not reimbursable by the Aero Club.</p><p></p><p>c.  Landing and tie-down fees (includes the hangar in severe weather) charged at en route and destination airports.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement for Privately Owned Boat and Helicopter.  When a privately owned boat or helicopter, but not a privately owned plane, is used to the Government’s advantage, reimbursement is for actual operating costs rather than TDY mileage.  Reimbursable costs are limited to:</p><p></p><p>1.  Fuel.</p><p></p><p>2.  Oil.</p><p></p><p>3.  Aircraft parking.</p><p></p><p>4.  Landing and tie-down fees.</p><p></p><p>5.  Boat docking fees.</p><p></p><p>Note:  To convert kilometers to statute miles, multiply the number of kilometers by 0.62.  To convert nautical miles to statute miles, multiply the nautical distance times 1.15077945.</p><p></p><p>D.  Requests for POV Expense Reimbursement (Service Members Only).  When it is to the Government’s advantage, the AO may authorize or approve reimbursing actual travel costs instead of mileage when all of the following three circumstances are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member requests it.</p><p></p><p>2.  The request is justified due to unusual circumstances and documents the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>3.  POV mileage reimbursement would be a financial hardship for the Service member (B-185733, September 1, 1976).</p><p></p><p>E.  Limits to Actual Expense Reimbursement for Travel by POVs (Service Members Only).  Actual expense reimbursement is limited to:</p><p></p><p>1.  Automobile or motorcycle: fuel, oil, parking fees, ferry fares; road, bridge, and tunnel tolls; winter plug-ins; and trip insurance for travel in foreign countries.</p><p></p><p>2.  Airplane: fuel, oil, parking fees, tie-down fees, and hanger fees.</p><p></p><p>3.  Boat:  fuel, oil, and docking fees.</p><p></p><p>F.  Cost Comparisons Between Use of a POV and Other Modes of Transportation (Computation and Calculation Rules).  When a traveler uses a POV instead of an authorized type of transportation, a cost comparison is done to determine reimbursement.  The POV mileage is compared to the constructed cost of the authorized transportation type and the lesser of the two amounts is reimbursed.  The constructed cost is the sum of the transportation ticket cost plus the TMC fee.  The per diem that the Government would have incurred if travel had been performed by the authorized transportation mode is paid.  No other costs, such as taxi fare or parking, are included in the comparison.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-11.  Cost Comparison Rules for Using a POV</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>Vehicle v.

Commercial Air</p><p>11</p><p>the use of an Aero Club aircraft is authorized or approved, and two or more official travelers are authorized to travel together,</p><p>reimbursement to the pilot is for the actual necessary expenses, limited to the Government’s transportation cost, for the pilot and accompanying travelers.</p><p>*See GSA City Pair Program</p><p></p><p>G.  Reimbursement for Mixed-Mode Travel When POV Is Involved.  When an individual travels partly by POV and partly by commercial modes between any two points listed as separate legs of the trip (see par. 020205), the travel is mixed mode.  Reimbursement depends upon whether or not use of the POV was more advantageous to the Government.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-12.  Mixed-Mode Allowances and Reimbursements</p><p></p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>Allowances</p><p>an individual travels partly by POV and partly by airplane, train, bus, or rental car for a leg of the trip,</p><p>the allowances are a combination of the following:</p><p>a.  TDY mileage for the distance traveled by   POV.</p><p>b.  The airplane, train, bus, or rental car transportation cost.</p><p>c.  Per diem for the actual en route travel.</p><p>Reimbursement for these allowances is based on whether or not a POV is advantageous to the Government.</p><p>2</p><p>Determining Reimbursement</p><p>POV use is more advantageous to the Government,</p><p>reimbursement is all of the above allowances, limited to the TDY mileage for the official distance, plus the associated per diem.</p><p>3</p><p></p><p>POV use is not to the Government’s advantage,</p><p>reimbursement is limited to the constructed cost of the authorized mode of transportation for the entire leg of the journey, plus the associated per diem.</p><p></p><p> H.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses.  If using a POV is more advantageous to the Government, in addition to a TDY mileage allowance, a traveler may be reimbursed for the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  Ferry fares.</p><p></p><p>2.  Bridge, road, and tunnel tolls.</p><p></p><p>3.  Parking fees in connection with official travel.</p><p></p><p>4.  Cost of obtaining an international driver’s license when the mission requires one, including the cost of the photos.</p><p></p><p>020211.  Car Ferry Transportation</p><p></p><p>Only a passenger automobile, light truck, or similar vehicle used primarily for personal transportation, regardless of size, is eligible for car ferry allowances.  A traveler who is authorized to use a car ferry must use a U.S. flag ferry, when available.  The English Channel tunnel (Chunnel) is considered a ferry only for computation purposes.</p><p></p><p>A.  Reimbursement for Car Ferry Transportation.  The AO may authorize reimbursement for car ferry transportation.  A traveler may be reimbursed for personal transportation costs, limited to the cost of Government-procured ferry transportation.  Reimbursement includes any costs associated with the vehicle’s movement on the car ferry.  The AO may also authorize TDY mileage for the official distance (based on the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD)) from both:</p><p></p><p>1.  The PDS location to the car ferry’s port of embarkation and the car ferry’s port of debarkation to the traveler’s TDY location.</p><p></p><p>2.  The TDY location back to the PDS location, again taking into account the ports of embarkation and debarkation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Excess Costs.  If the Government pays for transporting a POV on an oceangoing car ferry and that transportation results in excess costs, the Government will bear those costs and will not collect the excess costs from the traveler.</p><p></p><p>020212.  Travel in and around the TDY Location</p><p></p><p>A.  Travel Locations.  Transportation expense reimbursement in the TDY area may be authorized or approved for travel between:</p><p></p><p>1.  Lodging and duty site.</p><p></p><p>2.  Duty sites.</p><p></p><p>3.  Lodging or duty site and dining facility.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transportation Modes.  The AO may authorize or approve the most economical transportation mode at the TDY location that meets the mission requirements.  The transportation mode must be specified in the travel order if it is authorized before travel begins.</p><p></p><p>1.  When authorized or approved, a traveler using commercial transportation may receive reimbursement for local public transit system fares, taxi fares, or rental vehicle costs when using a rental vehicle is more advantageous to the Government.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a POV is authorized or approved, mileage is reimbursed at the TDY rate listed in par. 020210.</p><p></p><p>C.  Meals or Lodging Unavailable at Duty Site</p><p></p><p>1.  The AO may authorize reimbursement to a traveler for:</p><p></p><p>a.  Daily round trips between lodging and duty site when suitable lodging is not available at the duty site.</p><p></p><p>b.  Trips to dining establishments when suitable dining establishments are not available near the lodging or duty site.</p><p></p><p>2.  The traveler must furnish a statement that Government transportation was not available or, if available, was not suitable for the travel involved.</p><p></p><p>020213.  Ground Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Ground Transportation to and from Terminals and Rental Car Facilities.  A traveler should always use Government or courtesy transportation to and from terminals and rental car facilities, if available.  Travelers may use:</p><p></p><p>1.  Taxis or limousines.</p><p></p><p>2.  Buses.</p><p></p><p>3.  Streetcars.</p><p></p><p>4.  POVs.</p><p></p><p>5.  Rental vehicles when authorized or approved.</p><p></p><p>6.  Subways or other public transportation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transportation Network Companies.  Although travelers may use this transportation mode, as defined in Appendix A, cancellation fees and penalties charged by these companies are not reimbursable expenses.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-13.  Reimbursement for Ground Transportation to and from </p><p>Terminals and Rental Car Facilities</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a traveler uses a POV and the TDY requires at least one night’s lodging,</p><p>the traveler may be reimbursed TDY mileage for travel from the residence to the PDS on the TDY departure day, and from the PDS to the residence on the TDY return day.</p><p>2</p><p>a traveler claims any mandatory or customary transportation tips for a taxi or limousine service,</p><p>he or she may include up to 20% of the fare (the maximum allowed amount for a tip) as part of the total fare amount claimed.  The tip is not separately reimbursable.</p><p>3</p><p>a traveler uses a POV to or from home or place of duty to a transportation terminal,</p><p>he or she may be reimbursed for one-way mileage for each way at the TDY mileage rate.</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler uses Government transportation or a POV to take the most direct route,</p><p>the AO may allow ferry fares, and road, bridge, and tunnel tolls.</p><p>5</p><p>a traveler is dropped off or picked up in a POV when traveling to or from home or the place of duty and taken to a transportation terminal,</p><p>he or she may be reimbursed for a round trip at the TDY mileage rate.  The traveler must certify he or she incurred operating expenses if a person other than a family member drives.</p><p>6</p><p>a traveler parks at a terminal,</p><p>he or she may be reimbursed actual expense up to the cost of two one-way taxi fares.  The AO may waive this limitation for Service members when the TDY is longer than initially planned.</p><p>7</p><p>a rental vehicle is used to and from transportation terminals at the PDS or TDY location, or between carrier terminals, when authorized as more advantageous to the Government,</p><p>the standard list of expenses for a rental vehicle allowance plus transportation to and from the rental car agency may be reimbursed.</p><p></p><p>0203  PER DIEM ALLOWANCE AND OTHER COMPUTATION RULES </p><p></p><p>Per diem allowance rates are based on the TDY location, stopover point, or other authorized official duty points, but not on the lodging location.  Ordinarily, per diem is based on a traveler’s TDY location at 2400 hours (midnight).  If a traveler obtains lodging outside the area covered by the locality rate for the TDY location because of personal preference or convenience, then per diem is limited to the maximum rate prescribed for the TDY location.  See current per diem rates on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p>020301.  Daily Allowances</p><p></p><p>The Government pays per diem on a daily basis, for whole days.  This does not include PDS departure and return days.  The calculation of per diem allowances for each travel day is based on the actual amount paid for lodging, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate, plus the applicable meal rate and incidental expense (M&amp;IE) rate, unless otherwise stated in the JTR.  The total should not exceed the applicable maximum per diem rate for the TDY location.  If the U.S. Government furnishes meals and lodging at no cost to the traveler, then the total value of the meals and lodging plus the incidental expense rate is limited to the maximum locality per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>020302.  Allowable Travel Time As It Affects Per Diem</p><p></p><p>The AO determines the allowable travel time by the official distance, the type of transportation authorized, and the transportation used.  However, if the actual travel time is less than the allowable travel time, then the AO approves per diem only for the actual days traveled.  All time that is not official travel time must be accounted for in accordance with appropriate personnel regulations.</p><p></p><p>A.  POV, Government Automobile, or Rental Vehicle.  When travel is authorized as advantageous by POV, Government automobile, or a rental vehicle, one day of travel is authorized for every 400 miles, per Table 2-10.  See par. 050205 (Service members) and par. 053807 (civilian employees) for allowable PCS travel time.  Additional travel time may be authorized or approved when the actual time exceeds the authorized time for reasons beyond a traveler’s control, for example, for Acts of God.  Per diem is payable for any days of additional travel time that are authorized under such circumstances.  See POV travel computation example 1 and POV travel computation example 2.</p><p>B.  En Route Per Diem.  A traveler’s en route per diem is limited to the lesser of the actual time used or the time allowed for the authorized mode of transportation.  En route per diem is the per diem received between travel points excluding per diem while at the TDY or leave location.</p><p></p><p>C.  Airplane, Train, or Bus.  When a traveler receives authorization to travel by commercial air, the maximum time allowed in the CONUS and within areas OCONUS is one day.  When the Government purchases commercial air, train, or bus transportation, per diem is allowed for the actual time needed to travel over the direct route including necessary delays.  For travel by commercial train, the scheduled departure and arrival dates are used.  A traveler who elects to travel by a transportation mode other than the one authorized is limited to the actual time used, not to exceed the allowed travel time for the mode of transportation authorized.</p><p></p><p>Note:  When the authorized transportation mode is not used, the AO considers the traveler’s required check-in time, travel time from home or office to the airport, scheduled arrival time at the terminal, and travel time from the terminal to home as well as transportation costs when constructing travel.  Constructing travel is calculating estimated costs based on the authorized mode of transportation to compare to the traveler’s actual costs.</p><p></p><p>020303.  Lodging</p><p></p><p>A traveler on TDY must reserve lodging compliant with U.S. Fire Administration Guidelines through the electronic travel system or the servicing TMC (5 U.S.C. §5707a).  A DoD traveler must use the Integrated Lodging Program Pilot (ILPP) facilities if available.  The Government cannot direct the traveler to accept inadequate accommodations.  Each Service or DoD agency must ensure that 90% or more of all official travelers in the US or non-foreign areas OCONUS use commercial lodgings that comply with the U.S. Fire Administration guidelines.</p><p></p><p>A.  Booking Commercial Lodging</p><p></p><p>1.  A traveler is responsible for any charges in excess of the per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>2.  A traveler is responsible for canceling a room reservation within the established time frame to avoid any no-show charges and must obtain a cancellation number to reverse a no-show charge.</p><p></p><p>3.  If a traveler cannot book commercial lodging using the TMC (including the electronic travel system) then the traveler must book directly with the commercial lodging facility (including the hotel’s online Web site).</p><p></p><p>4.  If a traveler obtains lodging through an online booking agent, reimbursement is authorized only when the traveler provides a documented itemized receipt for room costs from the hotel or online booking agent showing the following charges (CBCA 2431-TRAV, September 13, 2011):</p><p></p><p>a.  Daily hotel room costs.</p><p></p><p>b.  Daily hotel taxes.</p><p></p><p>c.  Daily miscellaneous fees, if applicable.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Only itemized charges are considered for reimbursement.  Online booking receipts often break out the cost of the room, but combine taxes and fees.  In such cases, only the room cost is reimbursed because the receipt does not itemize taxes and fees.</p><p></p><p>B.  Booking Government Quarters and Government Lodging</p><p></p><p>1.  A DoD Service member ordered to a U.S installation must use adequate and available Government quarters.  When ordered to an ILPP site where adequate Government quarters are not available, a DoD Service member must use other lodging available under the Government Lodging Program.  </p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee ordered to a U.S. installation must use adequate and available Government quarters at designated Integrated Lodging Program Pilot (ILPP) sites.  When ordered to an ILPP installation where adequate Government quarters are not available, a civilian employee must use other lodging available under the Government Lodging Program.  When ordered to a U.S. installation that is not part of the ILPP site a civilian employee is encouraged, but not required, to use available Government quarters.  In no instance may a civilian employee be required to use inadequate lodging. </p><p></p><p>3.  Commercial lodging that is contracted by the Government, at no cost to the traveler, is considered Government quarters.  Lodging, at no expense to the traveler, may be booked without using the TMC, outside the electronic travel system.</p><p></p><p>Note:  The electronic travel system is used as the primary source to reserve Government quarters and Government Lodging Programs.  If the authorization is done outside the electronic travel system, then reservations must be made through DoD Lodging or by contacting the Government quarters facility directly.  The ILPP does not apply to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), or U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) personnel.</p><p></p><p>C.  Use of Government Quarters.  Government quarters are available to USCG, NOAA, and USPHS personnel only if the travel order directs their use.  For Government quarters policy for Service members, see Table 2-14.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-14.  Government Quarters Use</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a Service member is sent on TDY to a U.S. installation and the Government quarters on that installation (not nearby) are adequate and available,</p><p>he or she is required to use Government quarters. </p><p>2</p><p>a Service member is provided a non-availability number for an installation initially,</p><p>he or she is not required to seek or check for Government quarters when on TDY to that installation. </p><p>3</p><p>a Service member is on TDY at a foreign installation,</p><p>he or she is not required to check for Government quarters availability unless directed to do so in the travel order. </p><p>4</p><p>a traveler is participating in a combined exercise or operation on a foreign government installation, or attending a foreign service school, </p><p>the AO may direct use of Government quarters on that installation. </p><p>5</p><p>a Service member is ordered on a TDY to a Joint Base with geographically separated locations that do not share a common perimeter,</p><p>he or she must use Government quarters located on the part of the base where the Service member is performing duty, unless the Service member receives a statement of non-availability at that location.  A traveler should, but is not required to, use Government quarters at other locations geographically separated within the Joint Base. </p><p>6</p><p>adequate Government quarters are available on the U.S. installation to which a Service member is assigned TDY, but the Service member chooses to use other lodging,</p><p>the Service member is limited to the reimbursement cost of Government quarters on the assigned TDY installation (44 Comp. Gen. 626 (1965))).</p><p>7</p><p>adequate Government quarters are available on the foreign installation that a Service member is directed to use, but the Service member chooses to use other lodging,</p><p></p><p>8</p><p>adequate Government quarters are available but a Service member is directed to procure commercial lodging off the U.S. installation,</p><p>the Service member is treated as though no Government quarters are available and is authorized the locality M&amp;IE rate, instead of the Government meal rate (GMR) or the Proportional meal rate (PMR).</p><p></p><p>D.  Limiting Per Diem not Permitted.  Per diem reimbursement cannot be limited to the Government quarters rate if the installation to which a Service member has been assigned TDY does not have Government quarters, even if a nearby installation does have Government quarters.</p><p></p><p>E.  Government Quarters Are Unavailable.  Travel orders or travel vouchers must document when Government quarters are not available at the U.S. installation to which the traveler is assigned TDY.  The Services have predetermined that Government quarters are considered unavailable when: </p><p></p><p>1.  A TDY or delay point is somewhere other than a U.S. installation.</p><p></p><p>2.  An AO determines that using Government quarters would adversely affect mission performance.  This statement does not apply to:</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member attending a Service school at a Uniformed Service facility.</p><p></p><p>b.  Any officer in a pay grade of O-7 through O-10 or Senior Executive Service (SES) employee who personally determines quarters availability.</p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member has been assigned TDY at a medical facility as a non-medical attendant accompanying a dependent in an outpatient status.</p><p></p><p>4.  TDY is at a Joint Base without a common perimeter and the Government quarters are located at a geographically separate part of the Joint Base from the duty location. </p><p></p><p>F.  Required Documentation When Government Quarters Are not Available.  When Government quarters are not available, a DoD Service member is  required to obtain a non-availability confirmation number provided by the Service’s lodging registration process to justify reimbursement for commercial lodging and per diem.  When Government quarters are not available at an ILPP site, a civilian employee is required to obtain a non-availability confirmation number provided by the Service’s lodging registration process to justify reimbursement for commercial lodging and per diem. </p><p></p><p>Table 2-15.  Lodging Reimbursement Rules</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1 </p><p>a traveler does not use the available ILPP lodging at the ILPP site,</p><p>the traveler is limited to what the Government would have paid (the total of the ILPP negotiated lodging rate plus taxes, unless the traveler is tax exempt) and he or she is financially responsible for all other costs associated with other than ILPP site use.</p><p>2</p><p>an official traveler shares a room with a non-official traveler, </p><p>the official traveler is reimbursed the actual daily lodging cost based on the single occupant rate, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate.  A traveler who leases more spacious lodging to accommodate a non-official traveler is not reimbursed for the additional expense.</p><p>3</p><p>multiple travelers on official travel share a room, </p><p>each official traveler is reimbursed for the prorated share limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate**. </p><p>4</p><p>multiple travelers sign a lease for lodging, </p><p>each traveler is reimbursed for the prorated share of the lease amount, up to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate**.  The prorated share is based on all of the names of the official travelers on the lease, excluding non-official travelers.*</p><p>5</p><p>a civilian employee lodges with friends or relatives, </p><p>the civilian employee may be reimbursed for the additional lodging costs that the hosts incur for the accommodation if the civilian employee can substantiate the costs and the AO determines the costs are reasonable.</p><p>6</p><p>a Service member lodges with friends or relatives,</p><p>the Service member is not authorized lodging reimbursement (see par. 020304).  </p><p>7</p><p>a traveler is en route or arrives at the TDY or stopover location after midnight,</p><p>the traveler is allowed per diem** as if arrival took place on the preceding day.</p><p>8</p><p>lodging is not available at the TDY location,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve obtaining lodging in an adjacent locality where the per diem rate** is higher.  If the higher rate is not authorized in advance, the traveler must furnish a written statement with the travel voucher explaining the circumstances to validate an AEA based on the TDY location rate.</p><p>9</p><p>a traveler purchases or already owns a residence used for lodging during official travel, </p><p>reimbursement is not authorized for any costs or expenses associated with this lodging.</p><p>10</p><p>a traveler purchases a residence, to include a recreational vehicle (RV), used for lodging during official travel under a “rent-to-buy” option,</p><p>all associated mortgage interest and property taxes previously claimed must be repaid.</p><p>11</p><p>a traveler purchases, sells, or makes payments on a privately owned RV used for lodging during official travel, </p><p>reimbursement is not authorized for any costs associated with the purchase of the RV.  The traveler may be reimbursed the following expenses, limited to the total maximum lodging rate allowed for the entire TDY:</p><p>a.  Parking fees.</p><p>b.  Utility connection, use, and disconnection fees.</p><p>c.  Electricity, gas, water, sewage, bath, and shower fees.</p><p>d.  Dumping fees.</p><p>12</p><p>a traveler is lodged in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS,</p><p>a lodging tax is a reimbursable expense.</p><p>13</p><p>a traveler is lodged in a foreign area OCONUS,</p><p>the lodging tax is considered part of the lodging portion of per diem** and is not separately reimbursable.</p><p>14</p><p>no commercial lodging facility is available at the TDY location or a room shortage exists because of a special event, </p><p>the cost of lodging obtained in other than a commercial facility may be authorized or approved when the traveler provides a written explanation of non-availability acceptable to the AO.  Reimbursement cannot exceed the locality per diem rate**.</p><p>  *For multiple leasees, the long-term (not daily) lodging cost is split equally among the leasees, excluding  </p><p>    non-official travelers, before the daily reimbursement rate is computed.</p><p>**See current per diem rates</p><p></p><p>G.  Reimbursement for Commercial Lodging, Government Quarters, Other Lodging Arrangements, and Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses.  When a traveler procures long-term lodging, on a weekly or monthly basis, the AO computes the daily TDY lodging costs by dividing the total lodging cost for the period by the number of days the traveler is authorized the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate (see long-term TDY computation example 1).  Expense items that do not accrue on a daily basis are averaged over the number of days the traveler is authorized per diem during the TDY.  The AO includes the following costs in determining the long-term lodging cost:</p><p></p><p>1.  Utility connection, use, and disconnection.</p><p></p><p>2.  Dumping.</p><p></p><p>3.  Showers.</p><p></p><p>4.  Cleaning or maid fees.</p><p></p><p>5.  Cable TV.</p><p></p><p>6.  Automobile head bolt heaters, if ordinarily included in the hotel or motel rate in the area concerned.</p><p></p><p>7.  Monthly local telephone use.  Monthly fees does not include installation charges, unofficial long-distance calls, or monthly fees for a personally owned mobile phone when used instead of an installed phone for official communications.</p><p></p><p>8.  Parking space when RV is used.</p><p></p><p>9.  Appropriate and necessary furniture rental.</p><p></p><p>10.  Exchange fees involved in renting time-share lodging at the TDY point, but not the annual maintenance fee.</p><p></p><p>11.  Rental furniture or appliances.  No reimbursement is authorized for items that are contracted or rented with the option to buy unless there is no other alternative.  If an “option-to-buy” plan is used, the traveler must reimburse the Government the amount credited toward the purchase if paid as part of the travel claim settlement.  If a damage-waiver fee is required as part of the cost, the traveler may be reimbursed for the fee as part of the furniture rental (CBCA 1961-TRAV, July 20, 2010).  A traveler cannot be reimbursed for shipment or purchase of furniture (GSBCA 16699-TRAV, August 17, 2005). </p><p></p><p>Note:  These items do not apply to contracted TDY lodging.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-16.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses Associated with Lodging</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>the Internet (Wi-Fi) is required at the lodging location for official purposes,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve Internet connection charges.</p><p>2</p><p>certain fees are not optional, such as tourism, safe, service, or resort fees,</p><p>the AO may authorize reimbursement for them.</p><p>3</p><p>the TDY is canceled or curtailed,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve reimbursement of nonrefundable deposits, prepaid rent, late and early departure fees, limited to the remaining lodging and tax expenses that would have been paid.</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler must retain lodging for reasons other than personal convenience at one TDY location and procure lodging at a second TDY location on the same calendar day,</p><p>the AO may authorize dual lodging for up to 7 consecutive days.  Dual lodging covers lodging expenses due to unexpected circumstances beyond the traveler’s control.  Special approval through the Secretarial Process, after travel is complete, is required for reimbursement of dual lodging beyond 7 days.  The lodging cost at the first TDY location is reimbursed as a miscellaneous reimbursable expense, and the lodging cost at the second TDY location as per diem.  See dual lodging computation example.</p><p>5</p><p>the traveler cannot occupy lodging at the first TDY location due to conditions beyond the traveler’s control,</p><p></p><p>6</p><p>a traveler must retain airport daytime lodging for reasons related to travel arrangements and not for personal convenience,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve reimbursement for lodging fees or daytime lodging charges.</p><p>7</p><p>the traveler or organization would experience an economic impact by relinquishing lodging based on factors, such as daily, weekly, or monthly room rates; availability; storage charges; or shipment costs,</p><p>the AO may approve dual lodging for up to 7 consecutive days.  Special approval through the Secretarial Process, before or after travel is complete, is required for reimbursement of dual lodging beyond 7 days.  The lodging cost at the first TDY location is reimbursed as a miscellaneous reimbursable expense, and the lodging cost at the second TDY location as per diem.</p><p>8</p><p>dual lodging is requested and appears to meet criteria for approval,</p><p>the AO must verify the necessity based on reasonable and prudent actions of the traveler and must not authorize or approve it for the traveler’s convenience.</p><p>9</p><p>lodging is required on the day of departure from the TDY site,</p><p>the AO may authorize or approve reimbursement for the lodging based on the TDY locality rate or stopover point as appropriate.</p><p>10</p><p>advance room deposits are required by the lodging facility to secure a room reservation before official travel begins, </p><p>the AO may authorize reimbursement, unless the deposit is forfeited because the travel is not performed for reasons unacceptable to the DoD Component or Service.  In that case, the traveler is financially responsible for the advance deposit.</p><p>11</p><p>taxes on charges other than lodging, such as on movies or room service fees, are included in the lodging bill in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS,</p><p>reimbursement is not authorized.</p><p>12</p><p>a transaction fee for personally procured lodging is incurred and the traveler does not use an electronic travel system or an available TMC,</p><p>reimbursement is not authorized.</p><p>13</p><p> a TMC is not available and the traveler incurs a transaction fee for arranging lodging,</p><p>the transaction fee is a reimbursable expense.</p><p></p><p>Note:  For dual lodging, the actual lodging cost reimbursed at the first TDY location is limited to the per diem or AEA plus lodging tax that would have been paid had the traveler remained overnight at that location.  The dual-lodging claim must be supported by a receipt.  Long-term dual lodging is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>020304.  M&amp;IE Portion of Per Diem</p><p></p><p>M&amp;IE reimbursement does not require expense itemization or receipts unless an actual expense allowance (AEA) has been authorized or approved for some portion of the M&amp;IE.</p><p></p><p>A.  Meal Portion of Per Diem.  The meal portion of per diem covers expenses for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, including related taxes and tips for the meals.  Meal rates change depending on who the traveler is (Service member or civilian employee), the location, and the number and types of meals available.  After travel is completed, meal rates can be reduced only if the traveler received a deductible meal (see Table 2-18).  When a traveler stays with friends or relatives, he or she is authorized the TDY location M&amp;IE rate if otherwise eligible.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-17.  Types of Meal Rates</p><p>Type of Rate</p><p>Application</p><p>1</p><p>Locality</p><p>Meal Rate</p><p>Is based on the traveler’s TDY location or stopover point, and applies when the traveler must purchase all meals commercially.</p><p>2</p><p>Proportional</p><p>Meal</p><p>Rate</p><p>(PMR)</p><p>Applies when either of the following occur:</p><p>a.  A Service member is lodged in adequate Government quarters on a U.S. installation and one or two meals are available and directed in a Government dining facility on that installation.  PMR for available meals must be directed in the travel authorization.</p><p>b.  One or two deductible meals are provided at Government expense and at no cost to the traveler (for example, as part of a registration fee or conference fee) and the individual is not traveling.</p><p>c.  The PMR is computed by averaging the standard GMR and the meals portion of the applicable locality M&amp;IE rate rounded up to the nearest dollar.  Only the meal rate is used for the computation.  The appropriate incidental expense rate is added to the PMR to create the proportional M&amp;IE rate.</p><p>d.  The PMR does not apply when the traveler is traveling.</p><p>3</p><p>Standard Government</p><p>Meal Rate</p><p>(GMR)</p><p>a.  The standard GMR includes food and facility operating costs and applies when a Service member is sent TDY to a U.S. installation where adequate Government quarters and three meals a day are available in a Government dining facility on that installation.</p><p>b.  The GMR does not apply when the Service member is traveling.</p><p>c.  The GMR must be directed in the travel authorization.</p><p>4</p><p>Discounted</p><p>GMR</p><p>The discounted GMR is the cost for food minus facility operating costs.  A civilian employee is reimbursed the discounted meal rate if he or she is charged for food while supporting field duty operations.</p><p>5</p><p>Incidental Expense Only</p><p>Applies when all three meals are provided at no cost to the traveler.  Table 2-18 explains which meals are deductible.</p><p></p><p>B.  Determining if a Meal Is Deductible.  Table 2-18 defines what is considered a deductible meal and what is not.  See deductible meals computation example.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-18.  Deductible and Non-Deductible Meals</p><p>Deductible Meal</p><p>Non-Deductible Meal</p><p>1</p><p>Provided based on an agreement between the Government and any organization (except a Government dining facility) if the travel authorization directs the meal for a Service member or indicates the facility providing the meal is available for a civilian employee.</p><p>Box or bagged meal from a Government dining facility (for example, a Meal, Ready to Eat), except when that box or bagged meal from the Government dining facility is the only way to provide the Service member an adequate meal.</p><p>2</p><p>Included in a registration fee.</p><p>In-flight meals.</p><p>3</p><p>Paid by the Government and furnished at no cost to the traveler.</p><p>Furnished on a commercial or military aircraft. </p><p>4</p><p>Furnished at no cost to the traveler while attending a course of instruction at a school, if the Government ultimately pays the school for the meal’s cost.</p><p>Government meals consumed in a Government dining facility. </p><p>5</p><p>Provided by a lodging establishment for which an optional charge for a meal is added to the lodging cost.</p><p>Provided by a private individual other than the traveler.</p><p>6</p><p>Provided by a lodging establishment when meals are included in the lodging cost under an agreement between the Government and the lodging establishment.</p><p>A no-cost complimentary meal provided by a lodging establishment.</p><p>7</p><p>Light refreshments (including a continental breakfast), included as part of a registration fee if they meet the requirements above and are served at a meal time.</p><p>Light refreshments (including a continental breakfast) included as part of a registration fee if served during a break and not at a meal time.</p><p></p><p>C.  Deductible Meals Unable to Be Consumed.  The AO may authorize or approve the locality meal rate or the PMR whichever is applicable, if the traveler meets all of the following criteria in either of the following categories: </p><p></p><p>1.  Medical Requirements or Religious Beliefs.  The traveler meets all of the following criteria:</p><p></p><p>a.  Unable to eat an otherwise deductible meal because of medical requirements or religious beliefs.  The AO may require substantiating documentation from the appropriate professional authority.</p><p></p><p>b.  Attempted, but is unable, to make alternative meal arrangements for a substitute meal. </p><p></p><p>c.  Must purchase a meal that satisfies the medical requirements or religious beliefs.</p><p></p><p>2.  Requirements of the Mission.  The traveler is unable to eat an otherwise deductible meal due to requirements of the mission.</p><p></p><p>D.  Government Dining Facilities.  A Government dining facility is available only when the Government quarters on the U.S. installation on which the Service member is assigned TDY are adequate and available.  Government facilities should be used to the maximum extent possible.</p><p></p><p>1.  Use of the Government dining facility must be directed in the travel authorization.  The authorization must state when a Service member is to receive the PMR or GMR.  Otherwise, the locality meal rate is paid.  Schoolhouse training or other excepted circumstance may impact meal rate payable.</p><p></p><p>2.  A dining facility is considered not available:</p><p></p><p>a.  When Government lodging on the U.S installation is not available.</p><p></p><p>b.  On travel days.</p><p></p><p>c.  When an AO determines that:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The use of the Government dining facility adversely affects mission performance.</p><p></p><p>(2)  There is excessive distance between the Government dining facility and places of duty or lodging.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Transportation is not reasonably available between the Government dining facility and places of duty or lodging.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Duty hours and Government dining facility operating hours are incompatible.</p><p></p><p>3.  When a travel authorization directs the use of a Government dining facility for TDY travel and it is not available, a traveler must provide a statement of non-availability explaining which meals were not available and why, to receive reimbursement.  The reason for non-availability must be acceptable to and approved by the AO.  Once approved, the travel authorization must be modified to document the change in meal rate.</p><p></p><p>4.  An organization may not treat TDY members as permanent party by providing Government meals in a dining facility at no charge.  A TDY member pays for meals in the Government dining facility except in the following circumstances: Essential Unit Mess, field duty, sea duty, members traveling together with no reimbursement or Joint Task Force Operations.  See the FMR, Vol 7A, Ch 25. </p><p></p><p>E.  Incidental Expense Portion of Per Diem.  The portion of per diem reimbursement for incidental expenses includes, but is not limited to: </p><p></p><p>1.  Tips related to lodging, baggage, and transportation (to include courtesy transportation).</p><p></p><p>2.  Laundry and dry cleaning while OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  Various service charges.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Laundry and dry-cleaning expenses are a personal expense and are not reimbursable as part of per diem, AEA, or a miscellaneous reimbursable expense within the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>F.  Incidental Expense Reimbursement Rates.  The reimbursement rates for incidental expenses differ by location:</p><p></p><p>1.  CONUS Incidental Expenses are $5.00.</p><p></p><p>2.  OCONUS Locality Incidental Expenses are the rate when the TDY is not on a U.S. installation.  If the AO determines that a reduced rate for incidental expenses is adequate, then the $3.50 may be authorized.</p><p></p><p>3.  OCONUS Reduced Incidental Expenses ($3.50) are the rate when a traveler is assigned to a TDY at a U.S. installation and lodged in Government quarters, except for en route travel days.  If the AO determines that the $3.50 is inadequate, then the OCONUS locality rate for incidental expenses may be authorized and stated on the travel authorization.  This does not apply on any day the Service member is traveling.</p><p></p><p>020305.  Occasional Meals or Occasional Lodging</p><p></p><p>Occasional meals or occasional lodging may be authorized or approved when a traveler must either purchase meals from commercial or nonappropriated funds (NAF) sources, or obtain lodging through commercial, Government, or NAF sources when per diem is not otherwise authorized.</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member.  Occasional meals or occasional lodging may be authorized or approved when the Service member is:</p><p></p><p>1.  Escorting an arms-control inspection team or its members.  This applies within PDS limits, and only for a Service member escorting an arms-control inspection team or its members while engaged in activities related to the implementation of an arms-control treaty or agreement during the in-country period referenced in the treaty or agreement.</p><p></p><p>2.  On TDY within the PDS local area, but outside the PDS limits.</p><p></p><p>3.  Service members are traveling together with no or limited reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>4.  On TDY or training duty aboard a ship.</p><p></p><p>5.  On field duty.</p><p></p><p>6.  A Service member (straggler) who is separated from others traveling together under a travel authorization directing no or limited reimbursement travel.</p><p></p><p>7.  In Essential Unit Messing (EUM).</p><p></p><p>8.  Hospitalized as an inpatient.</p><p></p><p>9.  Part of the Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (SROTC).  Lodging and meal expenses are authorized or approved at a point of delay for an SROTC member traveling to or from field training or practice cruises and delayed through no personal fault at a location where neither Government quarters nor a Government dining facility is available.</p><p></p><p>B.  Reimbursement Limitation</p><p></p><p>1.  The lodging cost allowed is limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>2.  In special or unusual circumstances when the amounts claimed exceed the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate, the AO may authorize reimbursement for the actual cost of occasional lodging.</p><p></p><p>3.  When a Service member is required to procure or retain unoccupied lodging or to procure or retain lodging at more than one location on any calendar day, dual-lodging reimbursement applies.</p><p></p><p>4.  If the AO determines that a Service member is required to procure meals, then the reimbursement is the actual amount paid, limited to the PMR (no incidental expense), and based on the applicable locality per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>5.  If more than one locality is involved on any given day, the PMR limit is based on the highest locality M&amp;IE rate.</p><p></p><p>C.  Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee may be reimbursed expenses for occasional meals or occasional lodging expenses that the civilian employee must incur at a time when the meals or lodging are furnished without cost (or at nominal cost) for TDY of more than 12 hours.</p><p></p><p>2.  When the traveler is not authorized per diem, but must purchase meals and lodging:</p><p></p><p>a.  The AO may authorize or approve reimbursement for the actual amount paid, up to the PMR (no incidental expenses) for meals, or for lodging up to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate.</p><p>b.  The AO may authorize the actual expense allowance (AEA) if the actual meal expense is more than the PMR or the lodging cost exceeds the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>020306.  Meal Ticket Maximum Rates</p><p></p><p>Meal tickets may be issued to Service members only as specifically authorized by the JTR.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>020307.  AEA (Instead of Per Diem)</p><p></p><p>An AEA is a form of reimbursement that, in unusual circumstances, enables a TDY traveler to be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses that exceed the maximum locality per diem rate.  An AEA must be stated in the travel authorization when authorized in advance of travel.  All travelers going to the same place at Government expense, at which AEA is authorized, should be treated the same if possible.</p><p></p><p>A.  Maximum Amount.  An AEA is the lesser of the two: actual expenses incurred or the AEA maximum amount.  An AO may authorize or approve an AEA of up to 300% of the locality per diem rate (rounded to the next higher dollar).  See AEA computation example 1 .</p><p></p><p>B.  Computation</p><p></p><p>1.  The AEA must not exceed the approved percentage of the maximum locality per diem rate.  If AEA for lodging and M&amp;IE exceeds the maximum locality AEA per diem rate, then decrease the M&amp;IE AEA rate to the descending dollar and add the extra cents to the AEA lodging amount.  The daily amount is not prorated for fractions for the day; however, the AO must review and approve expenses incurred and claimed for a fraction of the day.</p><p></p><p>2.  The reimbursement method and daily maximum for the departure day from the PDS are the same as for the first location where lodging is required.  On the return day to the PDS, the same method and daily maximum applicable to the previous calendar day applies.  Par. 020310 applies for reimbursement when return travel to the PDS requires two or more days.</p><p></p><p>3.  Only one reimbursement method is authorized for each TDY location, except when one reimbursement is authorized for occasional meals and lodging.  When a TDY involves travel to multiple locations with more than one daily maximum reimbursement during a single trip, the applicable rate or reimbursement method for each calendar day, beginning at 0001, is determined by the traveler’s status and TDY location at 2400 on that calendar day.  See AEA computation example 2. </p><p></p><p>4.  When TDY is a special mission and non-deductible meals are available under special arrangements, AEA for such meals is limited to the charge for each meal or limited to the arranged charges for three meals per day.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-19.  Considerations Impacting AEA</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>traveling with a dignitary and it requires staying at the same hotel as the dignitary,</p><p>the traveler may be authorized an AEA.</p><p>2</p><p>traveling to an area where costs have escalated for a short period of time and it is during a special function or event, such as the following:</p><p>a.  A missile launch,</p><p>b.  A summit meeting,</p><p>c.  A sports competition,</p><p>d.  The World’s Fair,</p><p>e.  A convention,</p><p>f.  National or natural disaster, and its aftermath,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>affordable lodging is not available within reasonable commuting distance of the TDY point and the transportation cost to commute to and from the less expensive lodging facility would be more expensive than staying at the more expensive lodging,</p><p></p><p>4</p><p>the traveler must incur much higher expenses than normal during similar travel situations and the traveler must procure superior or extraordinary accommodations, including a suite or other lodging, for which the charge is well above what has usually been paid for accommodations,</p><p></p><p></p><p>C.  Traveling to Disaster Area.  An AEA is usually authorized on an individual trip basis.  However, the DoD Component has authority, using the Secretarial Process, to issue a blanket AEA authorization to cover the AEA expenses of all travelers in a presidentially declared disaster or pandemic area.</p><p>D.  Authority to Exceed 300%.  In rare instances, OCONUS, more than 300% of lodging may be required.</p><p></p><p>1.  Authority for a Service Member.  In advance of travel, the AO must submit a request directly to the Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC), Chief at the address on the first page of the JTR.  Requests must be addressed “ATTN: Policy &amp; Regulations Branch” when submitted by U.S. Mail or fax, or with the subject “AEA REQUEST” for a request sent by e-mail.  The Secretary concerned for specific classified missions OCONUS may authorize a Service member to receive AEA for lodging costs that exceed 300% of OCONUS per diem rates.  This authority cannot be re-delegated.</p><p></p><p>2.  Authority for a Civilian Employee.  No authority in the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) allows a civilian employee to be reimbursed more than 300% of AEA.  The civilian employee may be authorized AEA for lodging only or lodging and M&amp;IE, limited to the AEA maximum amount.</p><p></p><p>E.  AEA Authorized for Lodging Only</p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement of the actual cost of lodging, not to exceed the maximum amount authorized in the AEA, is allowed.</p><p></p><p>2.  M&amp;IE is paid at the locality per diem rate without itemization.</p><p></p><p>F.  AEA Authorized for Lodging and M&amp;IE</p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement of actual costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses is allowed and itemization is required.</p><p></p><p>2.  Items defined as incidental expenses (for example:  baggage and hotel tips) that do not accrue on a daily basis are averaged over the days at the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>3.  See AEA computation example 4.</p><p></p><p>4.  Reimbursement for Incidental Expenses may not exceed the Incidental Expense rates in par. 020304-F.</p><p></p><p>G.  Duration of AEA.  An AEA may be paid for the entire trip, during travel, or during a portion of the TDY.  However, an AEA that is paid for M&amp;IE applies by location for the entire TDY period at that location.</p><p></p><p>1.  Departure Day.  The reimbursement method and daily maximum for the departure day from the PDS is the same as for the first location where lodging is required.</p><p></p><p>2.  Return Day.  On the return day to the PDS, the same method and daily maximum applicable to the previous calendar day applies. </p><p></p><p>H.  AEA Not Payable.  An AEA may not be claimed for meals or lodging that is:</p><p></p><p>1.  Included in a registration fee.</p><p></p><p>2.  Procured at the traveler’s PDS or residence.</p><p></p><p>3.  Purchased while at or en route to or from a nearby carrier terminal when travel begins or ends there.  AEA also cannot be claimed when a meal is part of a transportation ticket price and is provided during the trip, but the traveler chooses to purchase a meal after leaving the airplane, train, bus, or ship.</p><p></p><p>020308.  Reduced Per Diem</p><p></p><p>An AO should request reduced per diem when a per diem rate is more than the amount necessary, based on known lodging- or meal-cost reductions in effect due to prearrangements, special discounts, or other reasons.  The AO must request and authorize reduced per diem before travel.</p><p></p><p>A.  Authority to Reduce Per Diem</p><p></p><p>1.  For a Service member, the authority to reduce a per diem rate rests with the DoD Component head or the Secretary concerned.  These entities may only re-delegate it to the chief of a DoD Component headquarters or the Service bureau or staff agency.</p><p></p><p>2.  For a civilian employee, only a DoD Component head may authorize a reduced per diem rate, except as otherwise specified in the JTR.</p><p></p><p>B.  Requests for Reduced Per Diem</p><p></p><p>1.  Reduced per diem rates may be requested for as low as zero and, once authorized, must be stated in the travel authorization.  If a request is submitted and approved after travel begins, an amendment to the original travel authorization is made, and applies to a future period.  The reduced per diem does not apply on en route travel days.  An increase to the reduced per diem rate for a travel period that has been completed can only be approved on an AEA basis.</p><p></p><p>2.  Requests for reduced per diem are submitted to the appropriate activity listed at Per Diem Rate Review and Reduction.  Requests must include the established lodging and meal costs, the traveler’s name, travel dates, the TDY location, the point of contact’s name and phone number for the request, and the recommended reduced per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>C.  Exception for U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).  USCG Service members assigned to detached duty at USCG stations (small), USCG Search and Rescue detachments, USCG air facilities, USCG auxiliary operation stations, and Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos may be paid 75% of the reduced M&amp;IE, if any, prescribed for the site on travel days, if applicable.</p><p></p><p>020309.  Trip Length As It Affects Per Diem</p><p></p><p>The length of a TDY trip has a major impact on the amount of per diem reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-20.  Per Diem Reimbursement </p><p>When travel is…</p><p>For the…</p><p>The per diem rate </p><p>is based on…</p><p>Computation</p><p>1</p><p>12 hours or less,</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>Per diem is not authorized.</p><p>2</p><p>more than 12 hours but less than 24 hours and no lodging is required,</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>the highest locality rate for each day.</p><p>75% of the highest M&amp;IE rate for each calendar day in a travel status.**</p><p>3</p><p>more than 12 hours but less than 24 hours and lodging is required,</p><p>Not applicable.</p><p>the TDY location or stopover point</p><p>Lodging up to the per diem rate plus 75% of the M&amp;IE rate for each day of travel.**</p><p>4</p><p></p><p>24 hours or more and no lodging is required en route,</p><p>en route travel days to the TDY location,</p><p>the rate for the next official destination.</p><p>a.  75% of the locality M&amp;IE rate for the day of departure from the PDS.</p><p>b.  100% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate for the subsequent  days of travel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>en route travel days from the TDY location to the PDS,</p><p>the rate for the last official destination.</p><p>c.  100% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate for the day of departure from the TDY location.</p><p>d.  75% of the locality M&amp;IE rate for the day of arrival at the PDS.</p><p>  5</p><p>24 hours or more and lodging is required en route,</p><p>en route travel days to the TDY location,</p><p>the TDY or stopover point where lodging is procured.</p><p>a.  Lodging up to the per diem rate plus 75% of the locality M&amp;IE rate for the day of departure from the PDS.</p><p>b.  100% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate for the subsequent days of travel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>en route travel days from the TDY location to the PDS,</p><p></p><p>100% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate for the day of departure from the TDY location.  75% of the locality M&amp;IE rate for the day of arrival at the PDS.</p><p> **Per diem payment for TDY of more than 12 hours but less than 24 hours may be taxable (IRS Rule 68-663 and 26 CFR § 1.162-2(a)).  The civilian employee should verify possible state and local implications.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Exception for U.S. Coast Guard.  For the day travel ends (return day to the PDS, home, or authorized delay point), per diem is based on the M&amp;IE applicable to the last TDY or authorized delay point whether or not overnight lodging was required.</p><p></p><p>020310.  Lodging and M&amp;IE Per Diem Calculation Rules</p><p></p><p>The calculation of per diem allowance for each day at a TDY location based on the actual amount paid for lodging, limited to a ceiling amount, plus an allowance for M&amp;IE, the total limited to the applicable maximum per diem rate for the TDY location concerned.</p><p></p><p>A.  Reimbursement While En Route from Home or PDS to TDY Location.  Lodging reimbursement is based on the actual cost of lodging, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate at the TDY location or at the stopover.  The M&amp;IE for the departure day is 75% of the M&amp;IE rate of the traveler’s stopover point or TDY location that night if lodging is used.  If the traveler is traveling overnight and does not use lodging, the M&amp;IE rate is based on the rate at the next destination.</p><p></p><p>B.  Reimbursement at Stopover Points.  A stopover point is necessary when travel is for more than 1 day.  That generally means that lodging is required.  Lodging at the stopover point does not include sleeping in the transportation terminal.  Per diem at a stopover point is based on the locality per diem rate at the stopover.  See stopover point computation example.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement at the TDY Location.  For each full day, a traveler receives the actual cost of lodging limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate of the stopover point or TDY location at 2400 hours, plus the applicable M&amp;IE rate.  If lodging is required for a TDY that lasts more than 12 hours, but less than 24 hours, then reimbursement is for the actual cost of lodging, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate plus 75% of the M&amp;IE rate.  A meal provided by a friend or relative or by a commercial company on an airplane, train, bus, or ship does not affect per diem.  A complimentary meal provided by a lodging establishment does not affect per diem as long as the room charge is the same with or without meals.</p><p></p><p>D.  Reimbursement While En Route between TDY Locations.  When a traveler departs one TDY location and goes to another, the M&amp;IE rate is 100% based on the traveler’s new TDY location (or stopover point, if lodging is used).  If the traveler is traveling overnight and does not use lodging, the M&amp;IE rate is based on the new TDY location.</p><p></p><p>E.  Reimbursement While En Route from TDY Location to Home or PDS.  Lodging reimbursement for a stopover point en route to the home or PDS is based on the actual cost of lodging, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem at the stopover point.</p><p></p><p>1.  The M&amp;IE for the return day to the PDS is 75% of the M&amp;IE rate for the preceding day (whether that day was spent at the last TDY location or at a stopover point, if lodging was used).  Any TDY locations en route on the day travel ends do not affect the M&amp;IE rate for that return day to the PDS or home.</p><p></p><p>2.  For U.S. Coast Guard Service members, the per diem is based on the M&amp;IE applicable to the last TDY or authorized delay point the day travel ends (return day to the PDS, home, or authorized delay point), whether or not overnight lodging was required there.</p><p></p><p>020312.  Return to Permanent Duty Station (PDS) During Long-Term TDY</p><p></p><p>Long-term TDY means continuous travel for 31 days or more (other than deployment).  For purposes of this provision, the return to the PDS location must be accomplished on non-duty days or during non-duty hours.  Any expenses greater than what is allowed are the traveler’s responsibility.  The return must be either to the PDS location or to the place from which a traveler commute daily to the PDS location.  There are two types of returns to the PDS location:</p><p></p><p>A.  Authorized Returns</p><p></p><p>1.  Authorized returns must be authorized in the travel authorization.</p><p></p><p>2.  Allowance is for the round-trip cost of transportation and per diem between the TDY location and the PDS location.  No per diem is payable at the PDS location.</p><p></p><p>3.  The AO may authorize or approve lodging retained at the TDY location during the authorized return as mission essential if the reasons for retaining the lodging are reasonable, necessary, and not merely for the traveler’s convenience.  Retained lodging is paid as a reimbursable expense, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate.  </p><p></p><p>Note:  Periodic return travel to the PDS is not authorized for U.S. Coast Guard Service members.</p><p></p><p>B.  Voluntary Returns.  A TDY traveler may voluntarily return to the PDS or residence from which the traveler commutes daily to the PDS during non-duty hours or authorized leave periods.</p><p></p><p>1.  No per diem or AEA is payable while at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Reimbursement is for the lesser of these two: round-trip cost of the transportation used, plus the en route per diem, or what it would have cost had the traveler remained at the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>3.  Lodging taxes are not included in the constructed cost when the TDY location is in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS because the taxes are reimbursable expenses and not part of lodging.</p><p></p><p>4.  If the TDY location is in a foreign area, then lodging taxes are included in the computation because they are part of the lodging cost and not separately reimbursable.</p><p></p><p>5.  For exceptions allowing retained lodging at the TDY location during voluntary returns, see Chapter 3, Part C and Chapter 6.</p><p></p><p>020313.  Tax Impact of TDY Travel on a Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>Long-term TDY may impact a civilian employee’s taxes when the duration of TDY travel at one location is more than 365 consecutive days.  Although the Government may consider this TDY travel, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may consider TDY of this duration as permanent and any travel and transportation allowances associated with that TDY as taxable income.</p><p></p><p>A.  TDY Changes.  If a TDY is expected to last less than one year, but the expectation changes some time during the TDY so that the TDY is anticipated to last more than one year, then the IRS may treat that TDY as temporary until the date that the expectation changed.  Allowances from that date forward at that location become taxable income.  Allowances received before the expectation changed are not taxable (see CBCA 2594-TRAV, April 13, 2012).</p><p></p><p>B.  Breaks Between TDYs.  There must be a 7-month break between TDYs at one location to stop the IRS 365-day clock.  When a TDY lasts less than 1 year at one location and the civilian employee returns to the PDS and then returns to the same TDY location for another TDY, allowances for the second TDY may become taxable.  The IRS may consider the second TDY a continuation of the first TDY if at least 7 months have not elapsed since the first TDY ended.</p><p></p><p>C.  Income Tax Reimbursement Allowance (ITRA) for civilians (FTR §301-11, Subpart F).  A civilian employee may partially offset the additional Federal, state, and local income tax liabilities that result from official travel through eligibility for an ITRA.  The ITRA will not reimburse a civilian employee for the full amount of the tax liability, as it takes into account only income taxes.  The ITRA does not compensate for employment taxes (26 U.S.C. §21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or Medicare) on these amounts.</p><p></p><p>D.  AOs Must Advise a Civilian Employee.  An AO must advise each civilian employee of the potential obligations for additional income tax if a TDY is expected to fall within possible taxable time frames.  State tax rules differ by state and locality.  The AO should advise each civilian employee to consult a tax expert for guidance on the tax impact on specific situations.  </p><p></p><p>E.  Agency Liability.  An AO must be aware that the Agency may be liable for the Agency portion of employment taxes related to the civilian employee’s TDY travel.</p><p></p><p>020314.  Impact of the International Date Line (IDL) on Per Diem</p><p></p><p>The IDL is an imaginary line along the 180th meridian where each calendar day begins.  Thus, when it is Thursday east of the IDL, it is Friday west of the IDL.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-23.  IDL Impact on Per Diem</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>crossing the IDL while traveling from West to East,</p><p>the traveler gains one day of per diem.  See international dateline computation example 1 and international dateline computation example 2.</p><p>2</p><p>crossing the IDL while traveling from East to West,</p><p>the traveler loses one day of per diem.</p><p></p><p>020315.  Other Circumstances Impacting a Traveler’s Per Diem</p><p></p><p>A.  Hospitalization.  A traveler who is an inpatient is not authorized per diem reimbursements during hospitalization except for specific circumstances.  See Chapter 3, Part D for rules regarding inpatient and outpatient treatment.</p><p></p><p>B.  Traveler Dies or Goes Missing While in a TDY Status.  A traveler is authorized transportation and per diem through the end of the calendar day of the death.  A traveler who is determined to be missing under the Missing Persons Act is authorized per diem through the end of the calendar day on which the traveler was declared missing (44 Comp. Gen. 657 (1965))).</p><p></p><p>C.  Personnel Are Traveling Together and Travel Authorization Directs Limited or No Per Diem Reimbursement.  The AO may direct personnel to travel together away from the PDS because the mission requires them to remain together, not just because it saves money.  Per diem is not authorized, even at a reduced rate, on travel days when personnel are traveling together; the travel authorization directs limited or no reimbursement; and transportation, food, and lodging expenses are provided without costs to travelers.</p><p></p><p>1.  The AO may authorize occasional meals and lodging when traveling, not at the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>2.  The rules on personnel traveling together begin when a traveler departs the PDS location and end at 2400 on the day that a traveler arrives at the TDY location.  Then, it begins again at 0001 on the day that a traveler departs the TDY location and ends when the traveler returns to the PDS location.  A civilian employee pays the food cost and operating expenses (surcharge) and is authorized reimbursement only for the food cost.</p><p></p><p>D.  Per Diem Payment During Field Duty.  Field duty is a specific status normally associated with war games and field exercises, and is so directed in the travel authorization.  During field duty, the Government provides lodging and meals to the traveler.  The lodging may be non-transient barracks or tents, and the meals may be field rations.</p><p></p><p>1.  Per diem is not authorized for a Service member in a field-duty status or for a civilian employee providing noncombatant support, or while accompanying, a military unit that is on designated field duty.  However, the senior commander in charge of an exercise, or a designee, may authorize per diem reimbursement if lodging is not available without charge or meals are not available without charge for an enlisted Service member.  The Secretary concerned authorizes payment of per diem, including reduced per diem.</p><p></p><p>2.  If a civilian employee pays the discounted GMR for meals consumed in a dining facility while on field duty or for field rations, then the civilian employee may be reimbursed the actual costs incurred.  The AO may authorize occasional meals and lodging expenses when needed.</p><p></p><p>3.  The field-duty rules on per diem begin 0001 on the day after arrival and end at 2400 on the day before the field-duty status ends.</p><p></p><p>4.  The Secretary concerned may authorize a lower per diem for a Service member on field duty deployed OCONUS away from the PDS.  The authorized rate is paid instead of the prescribed per diem rate and may be paid while the Service member is in field duty.  The total per diem paid during the entire period is about equal to the per diem that would have been paid for the time not in a field duty status.  The Secretary concerned may delegate the authority to a Department headquarters, bureau or staff agency chief, or Naval Systems Headquarters commander with no further delegation.  When authorized, the reduced per diem rate is paid regardless of the location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>E.  Essential Unit Messing (EUM) for Meals.  EUM refers to using the Government dining facility as a unit or group, and cannot be applied to an individual traveler.  It may be required for operational deployments or training for certain courses, when the Secretary concerned, the Combatant Commander, or the Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander determines that it is essential for accomplishing training and readiness or is necessary for military operations.</p><p></p><p>1.  EUM applies to organizational units, operational elements, operational deployments, or detachments.  When EUM has been established, the Government provides meals to a Service member, and the M&amp;IE is reduced to only the applicable incidental expenses.  The AO may authorize occasional meals and lodging when necessary.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee, when in EUM and in a training status, may receive the discount GMR.  The civilian employee in EUM while supporting an operational deployment or contingency operation receives the incidental expenses portion of per diem and the discount GMR.</p><p></p><p>3.  The rules on paying per diem for meals during EUM begin at 0001 on the day after arrival or the first full EUM day and end at 2400 on the day before EUM ends.</p><p></p><p>F.  Per Diem While Aboard a Government Ship.  Per diem for the arrival day on board and departure day are based on the port rates.  Per diem is not authorized on the days of arrival and departure from the ship, if the port is the traveler’s PDS and meals are furnished with or without charge.  The traveler is not charged lodging costs on a Government ship.  If a traveler must retain lodging at the same or prior TDY location, then the actual daily lodging cost is paid, not to exceed the locality lodging per diem ceiling for the TDY location ashore.</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member TDY aboard a ship is provided meals with or without charge, and is ineligible for per diem beginning at 0001 on the day after arrival through 2400 on the day before departing the ship.</p><p></p><p>2.  If a civilian employee pays for meals aboard a Government ship, the current GMR is paid for each meal, unless the AO authorizes a different special rate.  If the GMR is payable, reimbursement commences at 0001 on the day after arrival and terminates at 2400 on the day before the time aboard the ship ends. </p><p>3.  If a civilian employee performs TDY ashore and is authorized to procure lodging and meals at personal expense, then the civilian employee may be reimbursed up to the maximum locality per diem rate. </p><p></p><p>G.  Per Diem for TDY on a Foreign (Non-Government) Ship or TDY on a Ship Constructed by a Commercial Contractor (Acceptance Trials Before Commissioning).  A Service member is not authorized per diem when the Government furnishes both quarters and all meals without charge. </p><p></p><p>1.  If a Service member is required to retain lodging at the same or prior TDY location, then dual lodging is authorized in accordance with JTR rules.</p><p></p><p>2.  The rules on paying per diem on a foreign ship, or a ship constructed by a commercial contractor, begins at 0001 on the day after arrival and ends at 2400 on the day before the status ends.</p><p></p><p>H.  Per Diem While Traveling on a Commercial Ship for Travel of 24 or More Hours (Excludes Oceangoing Ferry).  Per diem is based on the port’s location for the arrival and departure days.  A traveler is not authorized reimbursement for meals if they are furnished without charge or included as part of the accommodations.</p><p></p><p>1.  A traveler is authorized reimbursement for meals equal to the furnished meal cost and the AO must set the meals portion of per diem equal to the anticipated expenses and indicate the circumstances warranting the rate.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the AO establishes a per diem rate payable for travel of 24 or more hours on a commercial ship, the per diem commences at 0001 on the day after arrival and terminates at 2400 on the day before the status ends.</p><p></p><p>I.  TDY In Connection with Fitting-out or Conversion of a Ship or Service Craft.  Per diem is authorized for a Service member during each fitting-out or conversion period.  This period includes the day the ship is commissioned or service craft is placed in-service, and the day the ship is decommissioned or service craft is placed out of service.  Per diem ends on the day the Service member’s assignment is changed from either of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  TDY in connection with fitting-out or conversion of a ship or service craft to permanent duty aboard that ship or service craft.</p><p></p><p>2.  Permanent duty aboard the ship in connection with ship decommissioning or placement of the service craft out of service changes, even if that status change takes place before the ship commissioning or decommissioning or before the date the service craft is placed in or out of service.</p><p>J.  Per Diem While Traveling on a Car Ferry.  If lodging on the car ferry is not required, then the M&amp;IE while on the ferry is the rate applicable to traveler’s location at 2400 on the day departing the ferry.  If lodging is required, then: </p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement for required accommodations is authorized unless included in the ferry transportation cost.</p><p></p><p>2.  The daily per diem rate for the arrival day on the ferry through the day before the departure day from the ferry is equal to the highest CONUS M&amp;IE rate.</p><p></p><p>3.  On the departure day from the ferry, the M&amp;IE rate is the rate applicable to the traveler’s location at 2400 on that day.</p><p></p><p>K.  Per Diem Not Allowed During Permissive TDY.  Permissive TDY is TDY at no cost to the Government.  See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy)for more information.</p><p></p><p>L.  Per Diem When Lodging and Meals Procured Under Contract.  A contracting officer may contract for rooms and or meals for a traveler on TDY, or a group of travelers.  The total daily amount the Government pays for a traveler’s lodging and M&amp;IE is limited to the applicable locality per diem rate for the location concerned or the authorized or approved AEA limit.  When lodging and meals are contracted, reimbursement is limited to the incidental expense portion of per diem and is not authorized for other items or services paid for by a traveler.</p><p></p><p>M.  Per Diem When Delaying Return Travel to Use Reduced Travel Fares.  When the traveler elects to stay at a TDY location longer than required by the assignment to qualify for reduced transportation fares and the AO authorizes or approves the action, per diem or AEA for the additional time may be paid if both of the following conditions are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  The delay does not extend the TDY time beyond the time when the traveler is required to be back at work at the PDS (B-192364, February 15, 1979; B-169024, May 5, 1970.</p><p></p><p>2.  The delay does not exceed the cost of travel as originally planned.</p><p></p><p>N.  Travel on a Non-workday to a Location Other than the PDS.  A traveler is authorized per diem on a non-duty or non-workday away from a TDY site at a location other than the residence or PDS for personal reasons.  Transportation costs are not authorized and the per diem is limited to the amount the traveler would have received at the TDY site.  See par. 033301 for effect of leave or administrative absence on per diem.</p><p></p><p>O.  Allowances When a TDY Is Abandoned.  When a civilian employee abandons a TDY for personal reasons acceptable to the AO, either before reporting to the TDY location or before the assignment is complete, then only travel and transportation allowances to the abandonment point are allowed.  If the personal reasons are unacceptable to the AO, then no travel and transportation allowances are authorized.  Costs to return to the PDS are the civilian employee’s responsibility unless the civilian employee completed the TDY.</p><p></p><p>P.  Brief Stay in the PDS Vicinity during a TDY</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee traveling between TDY locations who has to stop at the PDS airport in connection with the transportation and remain overnight at a hotel instead of going home or going to the workplace may be eligible for travel allowances.  The stay at the PDS vicinity is due to circumstances beyond the traveler’s control and not for the traveler’s convenience (GSBCA 16144-TRAV, November 14, 2003).</p><p></p><p>2.  Per diem must be paid as specified in section 0203.</p><p></p><p>Q.  TDY Location Becomes PDS</p><p></p><p>1.  Service Member.  When a Service member is on TDY and receives a PCS order that makes the TDY location the Service member’s new PDS, the impact on travel allowances is as follows (for travel to the new PDS, see Chapter 5):</p><p></p><p>a.  If the change is effective immediately, per diem at the TDY location stops effective on the day the Service member receives the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>b.  If the change is effective on a specified future date, per diem continues for the TDY involved and the return to the old PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>a.  Whenever possible, coordinate the civilian employee’s TDY with the notice about a change to the PDS so that the civilian employee has time to return to the old PDS from the TDY location.  This allows the civilian employee time to arrange for a residence sale, dependent and household goods (HHG) transportation, and travel to the new PDS in time to report for duty on the PCS effective date.</p><p></p><p>b.  Payment of per diem stops on the date the civilian employee receives notice that the TDY location becomes the PDS, unless he or she is performing a TDY at the new PDS before the transfer is effective.  In such case, per diem is paid and the TDY is terminated by a return to the old PDS, where the civilian employee performs substantial duty.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The civilian employee is authorized PCS allowances if the transfer is in the Government’s interest.  See Chapter 5 for PCS allowances.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If the PDS change is effective at some specific future date, and the civilian employee completes the TDY and returns to the old PDS before the PCS effective date, then return transportation and en route per diem are at TDY rates under the TDY order.  The civilian employee and dependents are then eligible for PCS transportation and per diem from the old PDS to the new PDS under the PCS order.  See Chapter 5 for PCS allowances. </p><p></p><p>(3)  If the PDS change is effective immediately, or if the civilian employee completes the TDY and returns to the old PDS after the effective date of the PCS orders, then transportation and per diem from the TDY location to the old PDS are at the PCS transportation and per diem rates under the PCS order.  The civilian employee and dependents are then eligible for PCS travel from the old PDS to the new PDS, also under the PCS order.  See Chapter 5 for PCS allowances.</p><p></p><p>(4)  When the civilian employee returns to the old PDS from the TDY location that becomes the new PDS, no per diem is payable at the old PDS, regardless of whether the return is before or after the effective date of the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>R.  Return to PDS Directed During Non-Workdays.  The AO may require a traveler to return to the PDS for non-workdays provided the conditions below are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  Expense for round-trip transportation and per diem or AEA en route is less than the per diem or AEA that would have been paid had the traveler remained at the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>2.  The last workday at the TDY location before returning to the PDS is not adversely affected.</p><p></p><p>3.  The first workday at the TDY location after return from the PDS is not adversely affected.</p><p></p><p>4.  The travel authorization states the traveler must return to the PDS for non-workdays.</p><p></p><p>S.  Navigational Proficiency Flights.  A Service member is not authorized per diem for a navigational proficiency flight when the flight is authorized or approved at the Service member’s request.</p><p></p><p>0204  MISCELLANEOUS REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES</p><p></p><p>Table 2-24.  Miscellaneous Expenses not Listed Elsewhere</p><p>1</p><p>Late payment fee on the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC*), incurred through no personal fault of the traveler, due to a mission-critical status (for example, when the traveler is unable to file a voucher due to circumstances specific to travel or when the AO does not approve the travel within 30 days, in accordance with DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 3 (DTS).</p><p>2</p><p>An international transaction fee of up to 1% for qualifying transactions charged by the GTCC* provider, as listed on the billing statement, or a personal charge card if the Service member is exempt from using the GTCC*.</p><p>3</p><p>A merchant surcharge of up to 4% on the GTCC*, or a personal charge card if the Service member is exempt from using the GTCC*.</p><p>4</p><p>Storage of baggage or property used on official business (when authorized or approved by the the AO).

Lawyer retainer fees are not reimbursable.  Official travel is normally on a no-fee passport.  The AO may authorize use of a tourist passport when travel is to a high-threat or high-risk airport by commercial air.  See the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for requirements and warnings before traveling to foreign countries.</p><p>11</p><p>Automatic teller machine fees in locations OCONUS only when the AO authorizes the expense in advance and after it was approved through the Secretarial Process by no lower than an O-6 or equivalent.  The traveler must document that the GTCC* cannot be used for security or local infrastructure reasons when traveling OCONUS.  The reimbursement is limited to the fees that the traveler could incur, based on the amount of cash advance that was authorized in the travel authorization.</p><p>12</p><p>The AO may authorize or approve reimbursement for the following costs related to military working dogs:</p><p>a.  Transportation cost of a military working dog, with the handler in the cabin, or as cargo; whether included in the handler’s fare or when billed separately.</p><p>b.

Shipment of HHG by a Service Member</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is on TDY for 31 or more days may be eligible for travel allowances to ship HHG.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Service members must comply with the limitations on weight and transportation for shipping HHG.</p><p></p><p>1.  TDY Weight Allowances</p><p></p><p>a.  The AO may authorize or approve shipment of HHG up to the weight allowance in Table 2-25 designated for the Service member’s grade.  In addition to the HHG weights authorized in Table 2-25, the AO may also authorize shipment of professional books, papers and equipment or required medical equipment as specified in par. 051304.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member’s grade on the day travel begins determines which weight allowance is allowed.  If the travel authorization is amended, modified, canceled, or revoked, HHG must be transported to the proper destination at Government expense (see par. 051302).</p><p></p><p>(2)  On a case-by-case basis, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher TDY HHG weight allowance, up to 1,000 pounds, for a Service member below grade O-7.  The higher weight allowance may be authorized when failure to increase the TDY weight allowance would create a significant hardship for Service member.</p><p></p><p>(a)  The TDY HHG shipment is in addition to, and does not include the weight of, any authorized unaccompanied baggage or any accompanied baggage included on a passenger transportation ticket.</p><p> </p><p>(b)  The weight of the TDY HHG is the actual unpacked and uncrated weight.  The Transportation Officer should establish this weight before packing if possible.  For details on determining the net shipping weight of HHG, see section 0514.</p><p></p><p>(c)  When a Service member is ordered from a TDY location to a new PDS, or when a TDY location becomes the new PDS, the weight of the TDY HHG shipment allowed is in addition to any weight allowance for PCS HHG shipments.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-25.

(up to 4,000 lbs. total), for the Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Commandant of the Coast Guard.</p><p>**A Service member selected as Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sergeant Major of the Army, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, or Senior Enlisted Advisor to the National Guard Bureau, who requires a TDY HHG weight allowance, is authorized 800 lbs. for a TDY order issued on or after receiving notice of selection to that position and for the remainder of the Service member’s military career. </p><p></p><p>2.  PCS Weight Allowance for Shipping HHG during TDY</p><p></p><p>a.  For the following situations, the Service member’s PCS weight allowance in Table 5-37, may be shipped in addition to the authorized or approved TDY shipment of HHG in Table 2-25.  Circumstances and locations warranting the addition of the PCS HHG weight allowance to the TDY HHG shipment are the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  A PCS with TDY en route (see par. 052007).</p><p></p><p>(2)  Orders directing a TDY with no return to the PDS, or directing the TDY pending further assignment.  If the Service member is required to vacate Government quarters, then HHG may be either packed and moved from the Government quarters to private sector housing in the old PDS vicinity, or placed in non-temporary storage (NTS) under par. 020503.</p><p></p><p>(3)  When a travel authorization for a TDY does not specify the duration and section 0312 (ITDY) applies.</p><p></p><p>(4)  TDY performed under an order pending a PCS to a PDS OCONUS.  HHG may be shipped to any combination of the following locations:</p><p></p><p>(a)  PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>(b)  Any location in the CONUS that the Service member specifies.</p><p></p><p>(c)  An NTS location (see par. 020503).</p><p></p><p>b.  For a TDY under an order pending a PCS assignment to a ship, the following apply:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Other than a PCS assignment to a ship described as “unusually arduous sea duty” or considered as possible or likely to be at sea for a year or longer.  PCS HHG weight allowances are authorized in  and section 0514.  HHG may be transported to a combination of the following:</p><p></p><p>(a)  The ship’s home port.</p><p></p><p>(b)  From Government quarters to private sector housing in the old PDS vicinity if required to vacate Government quarters.</p><p></p><p>(c)  NTS identified in par. 020503.</p><p></p><p>(2)  When a PCS assignment is described as “unusually arduous sea duty” or considered as possible or likely to be at sea continuously for a year or longer.  PCS HHG weight allowances are authorized in  and section 0514.  The designation of a ship, unit, or afloat staff as “unusually arduous sea duty” must be specified in writing through the Secretarial Process.  HHG may be transported to any combination of the following:</p><p></p><p>(a)  The duty station OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>(b)  Any location in the CONUS the Service member specifies.</p><p></p><p>(c)  NTS identified in par. 020503.</p><p></p><p>c.  A Service member on a TDY order in connection with building, fitting out, converting, or reactivating a ship is authorized PCS HHG weight allowances in  and section 0514 if the TDY order directs duty on board when the ship is commissioned.  The destination options for where to transport HHG depend on whether the sea duty is unusually arduous.  If the sea duty:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Is not specified as “unusually arduous,” then HHG may be transported to a combination of the ship’s home port and NTS under par. 020503.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Is specified as “unusually arduous” or considered as possible or likely to be at sea continuously for a year or longer, then HHG may be transported to a combination of any location in the CONUS the Service member specifies and NTS under par. 020503.</p><p></p><p>3.  Transportation</p><p></p><p>a.  The transportation methods in par. 051403 and section 0515 apply. </p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member on a TDY order may ship HHG anywhere if the origin is the TDY location or from anywhere if the destination is the TDY location.  However, the reimbursement is limited to what it would have cost to ship the HHG between these authorized points: </p><p></p><p>(1)  From the PDS (or home or PLEAD for an RC member) to the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>(2)  TDY location to TDY location.</p><p></p><p>(3)  From the last TDY location to the old or new PDS (see par. 051002 for a Service member released or separated from active duty from the TDY location).  If the TDY is pursuant to an order directing no return to the PDS, pending further assignment, indeterminate TDY, or in connection with a PCS, see par. 020501-B2a(1), par. 020501-B2a(2), and par. 020501-B2a(3) for locations between which shipment is authorized.</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG not authorized or approved for transportation, or not within the Service member’s TDY weight allowance must not be transported with authorized HHG.  The Service member must arrange separate transportation of such articles at personal expense.  If a HHG shipment at Government expense is discovered to include unauthorized articles, then the Service member is financially responsible for reimbursing the Government all costs expended to transport the unauthorized articles.  If the cost of the articles improperly transported cannot be established, see par. 051306-D.</p><p></p><p>d.  Service regulations may restrict the type of HHG shipped to a TDY location based on unusual circumstances, such as local customs, laws, or military necessity of the mission.  Any restrictions or limits on the content of the HHG authorized for shipment must be stated on the travel authorization.</p><p></p><p>C.  Lost or Destroyed HHG</p><p></p><p>1.  When an original HHG shipped while on TDY is destroyed or lost during transport, through no fault of the Service member, a replacement shipment within the authorized weight allowance may be made at Government expense (68 Comp. Gen. 143 (1988))).</p><p></p><p>2.  A designated Service representative may authorize or approve forwarding an authorized HHG shipment while on TDY to the proper destination when, through no fault of the Service member, the HHG shipment is misdirected or otherwise separated from the Service member.</p><p></p><p>020502.  Storage in Transit and Special Storage of HHG by a Service Member</p><p></p><p>HHG storage for a Service member may be authorized as either storage in transit (SIT) or special storage.</p><p></p><p>A.  Storage in Transit (SIT) Eligibility.  A Service-designated official may authorize or approve SIT as necessary for reasons beyond the Service member’s control if the Service member is either on a PCS with a TDY or deployment en route or is on a TDY or deployment for 90 days or less.</p><p></p><p>B.  SIT Allowances.  The Service member’s HHG, up to the TDY weight allowance, may be placed in SIT.</p><p>Note:  See Chapter 5 when HHG are in SIT and the Service member is on a PCS with deployment or TDY for 91 or more days, or for an indefinite period.</p><p></p><p>C.  Special Storage Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  Active-duty Service Member.  The Secretarial Process may authorize or approve special storage when a Service member is on a TDY or deployment for 91 or more days, or an indefinite period, and no PCS is involved.</p><p></p><p>2.  RC Member.  The Secretarial Process may authorize or approve special storage for an RC member who is called or ordered to active duty under emergency or extenuating circumstances for reasons other than training and who is ordered to a TDY for any length of time or to a deployment.</p><p></p><p>D.  Special Storage Allowances.  The Service member’s HHG, up to the PCS weight allowance, may be placed in special storage when authorized or approved.  Storage costs include shipment, drayage, packing, crating, unpacking, and uncrating necessary to place HHG into or remove them from a storage facility.  See Chapter 5 for storage facility selection.  Special storage cannot be authorized or approved for a Service member who is authorized a “home of selection” allowance and has HHG in NTS when recalled to active duty.</p><p></p><p>E.  Storage after TDY or Deployment.  HHG storage may continue for up to 90 days after the TDY or until deployment is completed.  Extensions to this 90-day period may be authorized in accordance with section 0518-A.</p><p></p><p>020503.  NTS by a Service Member</p><p></p><p>A.  NTS Eligibility.  NTS is authorized only when a Service member is ordered on a PCS with TDY en route or while on a TDY in the situations listed in Table 2-26.</p><p></p><p>B.  NTS Allowances.  NTS begins on the day the travel authorization is issued and continues for as long as any of the situations in Table 2-26 exist.  NTS may continue for 90 days or less after the TDY or until deployment is completed.  Extensions to this 90-day period may be authorized in accordance with section 0518-B.</p><p></p><p>Table 2-26.  NTS While on a TDY</p><p>If the TDY is…</p><p>Then the last day of storage is…</p><p>1</p><p>without a return to the PDS or is pending further assignment,*</p><p>the departure day from the TDY location when an order assigns a new PDS.</p><p>2</p><p>an ITDY,**</p><p>the departure day from the last TDY location before proceeding to the new PDS.</p><p>3</p><p>pending an assignment OCONUS or to a ship,*</p><p>the departure day from the last TDY location before proceeding to a location OCONUS or to the assigned ship.</p><p>4</p><p>in connection with building, fitting out, converting, or reactivating of a ship and duty aboard the ship when commissioned,*</p><p>the ship’s arrival day at its assigned home port.</p><p>For more information about the above situations, see par. 020501-B2* and Section 0312**.</p><p></p><p></p><p>020504.  Removal of HHG from Storage by a Service Member</p><p></p><p>A.  Delivery out of Storage.  Delivery of HHG out of storage is authorized at Government expense as long as the travel authorization and the transportation allowances are valid, regardless of the length of time in storage.  This includes shipments that have been converted to storage at the Service member’s expense.</p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Shipment after Storage.  When applicable, HHG may be shipped to any point in the CONUS in accordance with par. 052002.  HHG stored under section 0518-A or under one of the following conditions may be transported to any subsequent PDS:</p><p></p><p>1.  A TDY order that is without return to a PDS or pending further assignment.</p><p></p><p>2.  A TDY order pending assignment to a location OCONUS or to a ship.</p><p></p><p>3.  An ITDY order.</p><p></p><p>020505.  Shipment of HHG by a Civilian Employee on TDY</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee on TDY for 31 days or more may be authorized or approved unaccompanied baggage.  No other HHG shipment is authorized in connection with a long-term assignment treated as a TDY.</p><p></p><p>Note:  For a civilian employee on a TDY lasting between 6 months and 30 months that is treated as a temporary change of station, see Chapter 5.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowance.  The unaccompanied baggage weight limit is 350 pounds.  Unaccompanied baggage is limited to additional clothing, personal effects, and equipment directly related to the mission, locality, or unusual conditions of the TDY.  No authorization exists for excess accompanied baggage when unaccompanied baggage is authorized.</p><p></p><p>0206  TRAVEL IN AND AROUND THE PDS </p><p></p><p>The DoD installation, base, or senior commanders must establish, in a written directive, the local area within which DoD travelers are eligible for reimbursement, even if they come from different commands, units, installations, or Agencies (59 Comp. Gen. 397 (1980)).  If the activity does not have a senior commander or is not located on a military installation, then the senior official determines the local area for that PDS location.

Conference Attendance and Participation </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A traveler may be authorized to attend a conference or meeting that contributes to improved conduct, supervision, or management of a Uniformed Service’s or Department of Defense (DoD) Component’s functions and activities (5 U.S.C. §4110 and 37 U.S.C. §455).  Participation and attendance may also be authorized to maintain and improve professional competency if funds are available and work responsibilities permit.  Attendance at technical, scientific, professional, or similar meetings, as well as private membership in non-Federal societies and organizations, may also be authorized (38 Comp. Gen. 800 (1959)).</p><p></p><p>1.  Government-Sponsored Conferences.  Attendance at Government expense may be authorized when the traveler’s attendance at a conference is required or related to executing official duties, for conducting Government business.  This includes:</p><p></p><p>a.  Conferences sponsored or co-sponsored by a Federal Agency required in the performance of official duties.</p><p></p><p>b.  Conferences of state or municipal government organizations, or of international agencies in which the Federal Government is officially participating when it is related to official duties or for the purpose of transacting Government business.</p><p></p><p>c.  Conferences of a group of individuals representing private interests, but convened for the purpose of transacting business directly related to the Services or the DoD Component function or activity and attendance is in the Service member or civilian employee’s official performance.</p><p></p><p>2.  Conferences not Sponsored by Government.  Conference attendance at non-Federal technical, scientific, professional, and comparable private-membership organizations may be authorized, subject to Service or DoD Component regulations and in accordance with DoD 5500.07-R (Joint Ethics Regulation) which specifies the regulations on acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel expenses.</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member or a civilian employee may attend conferences at Government expense to further Service or DoD Component programs, present scientific and technical papers that advance the development of U.S. resources, or maintain an effective professional, scientific, technical, managerial, and supervisory workforce.</p><p></p><p>b.  An appropriate security officer at the traveler’s activity should examine the security implications for attendance at all meetings and conferences conducted or sponsored by private or international organizations.  A Service member or civilian employee who attends such meetings must be briefed about security implications, when necessary, before attendance.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Conference registration fees authorized in the travel authorization or approved on a travel voucher are reimbursable.  The travel authorization should state:</p><p></p><p>a.  Whether the conference registration fee includes charges for meals and, if so, the number of meals and the dates furnished.  The proportional meal rate (PMR) applies on any day that the cost for one or two meals is included in the conference registration fee (see Chapter 2).</p><p></p><p>b.  When the conference registration fee includes lodging without charge and, if so, the number of lodgings and the dates furnished.  Only the appropriate and applicable PMR or TDY locality meal rate and incidental expenses (M&amp;IE) rate is paid.  If all three meals are provided, then the traveler receives the incidental expenses portion of per diem only.</p><p></p><p>2.  When the Service or DoD Component sponsors a conference, meal costs must be identified, whether included in a conference registration fee or contracted for separately.  Unless the AO has authorized or approved an actual expense allowance (AEA) for meals (for attendees in a travel status) reimbursement is limited to the locality meal rate.  The maximum contracted amount for one or two meals for an attendee in a travel status is limited to the difference between the locality meal rate and the PMR.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement</p><p></p><p>1.  A conference registration fee may be reimbursed when attendance is authorized for a conference in the local area that is not held at the PDS does not involve travel, per diem, or a travel authorization. </p><p></p><p>2.  Charges or fees for light refreshments or snacks are reimbursable only when included as part of the conference registration fee.  However, when the only purpose for a registration fee is to provide light snacks or refreshments, it is not reimbursable.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Conference registration fees, meals, lodging, travel, or other expenses required for conferences or training at the PDS cannot be paid as travel allowances per 37 U.S.C. §474.  Authority to pay related training costs at the PDS is in 10 U.S.C. §2013; 5 U.S.C. §4109; 42 U.S.C. §218(a) and 14 U.S.C. §469.</p><p></p><p>3.  Entertainment expenses for social events, such as ice breakers, and other personal expenses not directly required by official duties are not reimbursable. </p><p></p><p>D.  Funds Advance.  Advance payment of discounted conference registration fees (FTR §301-74.23) is a common practice when conference planners offer discounted “early bird” registration fees, which are available in the months before the conference begins.  If an individually billed Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) is used to take advantage of such specials, a traveler should receive a verbal or written authorization to register early and charge the conference registration fee to the GTCC.  A written authorization to attend the conference is required to claim reimbursement for the discounted conference registration fee as soon as a written order is generated.  When the authority to register early is verbal, the written authorization must reference the verbal authority for the early conference registration.  This does not prevent other payment methods for advance conference registration fees, such as a Government Purchase Card.</p><p></p><p>E.  Traveler is Unable to Attend an Event for which Reimbursement Was Made (adopted from FTR §301-74.24).  If a traveler was reimbursed a discounted conference registration fee before the event and then fails to attend the event, then he or she must seek a refund and repay the Government for the advance. </p><p></p><p>1.  If no refund is made, then the advanced payment must be absorbed as a preparatory travel expense if the traveler’s failure to attend the event was because of:</p><p></p><p>a.  A decision by the Service or DoD Component concerned.</p><p></p><p>b.  An acceptable reason beyond the traveler’s control, such as an emergency or illness.</p><p></p><p>2.  If no refund is made, and the traveler’s failure to attend the event was due to a reason unacceptable to the Service or DoD Component concerned, the traveler must repay the amount advanced.</p><p></p><p>0303  RESERVE COMPONENT (RC) TRAVEL (OTHER THAN TRAINING)</p><p></p><p>“Reserve Component” (RC) refers to the Army Reserve, the Navy Reserve, the Marine Corps Reserve, the Army National Guard of the United States, the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard of the United States, the Coast Guard Reserve, and the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service </p><p>(37 U.S.C. §101).</p><p></p><p>030301.

However, the reimbursement is limited to what it would have cost for transportation had the traveler only traveled between the RC member’s primary residence and duty location.</p><p></p><p>b.  When the original duty period is extended due to unforeseen circumstances, standard travel and transportation allowances continue for the entire period as long as the days remaining on the existing order, plus the number of days added by the extension, total 180 or fewer days.  </p><p></p><p>2.  181 or More Days at Any One Location (with No Break in Service) When the RC Member Does Not Commute </p><p></p><p>a.  An assignment that lasts for 181 or more days at one location becomes a PCS (see Chapter 5).  Per diem is not payable at the PCS location. </p><p></p><p>b.  When an original order is amended to extend the TDY to 181 or more days from the date of the amendment, the TDY location becomes a PDS.  Travel and transportation allowances are not payable beginning from the day of the amended order.  </p><p></p><p>c.

A spouse is authorized to travel.</p><p></p><p>a.  A spouse of a Service member or civilian employee is traveling for a representational purpose that is not mission essential.  The spouse’s invitational travel must meet all of the following applicable conditions:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The AO determines that a spouse may travel with the sponsor, at Government expense, when the spouse’s presence would further the interests of the DoD, the Military Service, or the Command when the spouse travels to:</p><p>(a)  Attend a function in which the DoD sponsor is participating in an official capacity and in which the spouse is to address those assembled or otherwise play an active role and visible part.</p><p></p><p>(b)  Attend a function (with or without the DoD sponsor) attended by spouses of community leaders, government officials, foreign dignitaries, or foreign military officers with whom the sponsor is meeting in an official capacity.</p><p></p><p>(c)  Attend a function (with or without the DoD sponsor) where a substantial number of those present are military families or where the focus is on matters of particular concern to military families.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Travel is allowed on a mission noninterference basis.</p><p></p><p>b.  The spouse of a Service member or civilian employee is traveling for unquestionably mission essential reasons and there is a benefit for DoD beyond fulfilling a representational role.

On a case-by-case basis, Code 2 civilians, four-star General Officers or Flag Officers, and certain three-star General Officers or Flag Officers serving outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or as a Combatant Commander (CCDR), in DoDD 4500.56 (Government Aircraft and Air Travel) may authorize or approve transportation, per diem, or other expense allowances for their spouses.  Spousal travel, when authorized or approved, must adhere to the criteria in DoDD 4500.56 and DoDI 4515.13 (Air Transportation Eligibility).  This authority does not constitute blanket approval authority.</p><p></p><p>d.

For spousal travel under par. 030501-A10, the allowance is for Government-funded transportation only.</p><p></p><p>a.  The travel authorization must include the following statement: “This travel authorization authorizes the spouse to accompany the sponsor to attend an official function.  It does not authorize per diem or other expense allowances for the spouse.  If the spouse does not desire to bear the expenses ordinarily reimbursed through per diem or other expense allowances, this travel authorization is canceled.”</p><p></p><p>b.

Authorization or approval of spousal travel for official purposes requires the exercise of good judgment in application.  AOs must be mindful of the need to withstand public scrutiny and avoid the appearance that spousal travel is being abused.</p><p></p><p>C.  Restrictions.  Invitational travel must not be authorized for: </p><p></p><p>1.  A non-appropriated fund official or civilian employee traveling on non-appropriated fund business.</p><p></p><p>2.

Transportation expenses for local travel (when all official travel is located in the same metropolitan or geographic area) between the traveler’s home or place of business and the place of TDY.</p><p></p><p>3.  Travel expenses for recurring round-trip travel between the traveler’s home or place of business and the place of TDY when it adheres to par. 020203.</p><p></p><p>4.

A Service member on leave travels on an ITA for pre-employment interview travel.  </p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee on leave from his or her DoD employment travels on an ITA for pre-employment interview travel.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement</p><p></p><p>1.  Each DoD Component must establish qualification criteria for determining which applicants receive payment for pre-employment interview travel expenses.  Guidance in creating qualification criteria is in 5 CFR §572. </p><p></p><p>2.  A DoD Component may pay all or part of pre-employment travel expenses to or on behalf of the interviewee.  When electing to pay only per diem or only transportation costs, the DoD Component must pay the full amount for the selected expenses as authorized for a civilian employee.  The DoD Component must reimburse the interviewee for the offered and allowable travel expenses upon submission and approval of a travel voucher except for a separate room not used for the traveler’s lodging, such as a meeting room. </p><p></p><p>D.  DoD Component Responsibilities.  A DoD Component must adhere to the general travel authorization policies and practices in the JTR.  Pre-employment interview travel may be authorized only on a trip-by-trip basis.  A limited or unlimited open travel authorization must not be used for pre-employment interview travel.  See section 0305.</p><p></p><p>1.  A DoD Component must communicate DoD travel rules and procedures to the interviewee and should ensure that the interviewee understands how travel reimbursements are calculated.  The DoD Component provides the interviewee with written instructions when a travel authorization is issued explaining the administrative procedures for controlling and accounting for passenger transportation documents.</p><p></p><p>2.  A DoD Component must not authorize reimbursement for pre-employment interview travel expenses to help defray permanent change of station (PCS) expenses that are not allowable for a new appointee under par. 054801.  For example, a DoD Component may not pay pre-employment travel expenses under this section so that an interviewee or new appointee may look for a house at the prospective first PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.

The DoD Component must advise the interviewee to keep a record of expenditures chargeable to the Government, including retaining all receipts, until reimbursement claims are settled.</p><p></p><p>E.  Interviewee Responsibilities.  The interviewee is expected to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business.</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation tickets should be provided by the interviewing DoD Component.  The interviewing DoD Component may authorize the interviewee to obtain tickets directly from a Travel Management Company (TMC) under contract to the Government.</p><p></p><p>2.

The interviewee is responsible for, and accountable for, all transportation tickets and Government-procured transportation documents issued until they are used for pre-employment interview travel or are otherwise accounted for properly.  A statement to this effect must be incorporated on the travel authorization, or issued as a “Notice to Traveler” and attached to the ticket or transportation document when issued to the interviewee.  This statement must also inform the interviewee that he or she is financially responsible for the value of the tickets issued if the interview trip is canceled or rescheduled after tickets or Government-procured transportation documents are issued.</p><p></p><p>4.  If the interviewee exchanges a ticket for one of lesser value, then the carrier should issue a receipt or a ticket-refund application.  The carrier is required to make a refund directly to the appropriate DoD Component billing office.  The DoD Component must provide the interviewee with a “bill charge to” address for the carrier to use in sending a refund by attaching a copy of the transportation document, or some other document containing this information, to the ticket or travel authorization (41 CFR §101-41.210-1).</p><p></p><p>F.  Funds Advance.  The interviewee cannot be issued a travel advance.

A person other than a Service member or civilian employee, who is called to testify as a witness at a preliminary hearing conducted under Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice, is issued an ITA and authorized travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 for a civilian employee on TDY.  Effective May 1, 2017.</p><p></p><p>B.  Adverse Action Case Involving Service Member or Civilian Employee.  The presiding hearing officer must determine that the witness’s testimony is substantial, material, and necessary for proper case disposition and that an affidavit from the desired witness cannot adequately accomplish the same objective.  A witness not employed by the Government who is called to testify in administrative proceedings on behalf of the Government is issued an ITA and authorized the same standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 for a civilian employee on TDY.</p><p></p><p>C.  Federal Administrative Hearing.  When a complainant who is no longer a Government employee serves as a witness in an administrative hearing related to his or her Federal employment, he or she is issued an ITA and is eligible for the same standard travel and transportation allowances as a civilian employee in Chapter 2 if retroactively reinstated to Federal service.  The hearing must be within Federal employment regulations it would be unreasonable to require the complainant to appear at personal expense (B-180469, February 28, 1974).</p><p></p><p>030703.  Juror Travel </p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who serves as a juror does not receive travel and transportation allowances through the policies in this regulation and is not issued a TDY order.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>030704.  Travel Associated with Sexual Assault </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is a sexual assault victim traveling to testify or participate in a court martial, hearing, pre-trial interview, or other hearing or panel, including Congressional, in connection with the sexual assault is eligible for travel allowances (DoDD 6495.01 (Sexual Assault Prevention).</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A traveler is authorized the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.  Ordinarily, the appropriate office for issuing subpoenas or other requirements to appear for the event requiring the victim to testify or participate will fund and authorize the travel for the victim.  The sexual assault victim’s commanding officer or AO may authorize or approve an escort to accompany the sexual assault victim on the trip, or a medical authority may authorize an attendant when required.  If the sexual assault victim is not a Service member or civilian employee, then the Service or Agency determines which AO authorizes or approves an attendant or escort.</p><p></p><p>C.  Attendant or Escort.  Table 3-3 provides the allowances for an attendant or escort to travel. </p><p></p><p>Table 3-3.  Attendant or Escort Allowances for a Sexual Assault Victim</p><p>If the attendant or escort is…</p><p>Then the allowances are…</p><p>1</p><p>a Service member or a civilian employee,</p><p>the travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p>2</p><p>a non-DoD Government civilian employee when the Agency funding the travel is not a DoD Agency,</p><p>the TDY travel and transportation allowances in accordance with the regulations issued by the Agency funding the travel.</p><p>3</p><p>a non-DoD Government civilian employee when the Agency funding the travel is a DoD Agency,</p><p>the same travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 as a civilian employee on a TDY.</p><p>4</p><p>a non-Government civilian traveling on an ITA,</p><p></p><p></p><p>030705.  Threatened Civilian Law Enforcement Officer</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.

Allowances.  The DoD Component may authorize or approve transportation and certain subsistence expenses in FTR §301-31.</p><p></p><p>C.  DoD Component Responsibilities</p><p></p><p>1.  The DoD Component head can delegate the authority to authorize or approve payment of transportation expenses and an allowable subsistence in this section.  Re-delegated authority must stay at the highest level practicable to ensure proper review of the circumstances that may necessitate protective action, including moving an eligible individual from home.</p><p></p><p>2.  The DoD Component must establish specific administrative procedures for issuing travel authorizations and for payment of claims arising from threats to civilian law enforcement officers.</p><p></p><p>D.  DoD Risk Evaluation Process</p><p></p><p>1.  When a situation occurs that appears to be life-threatening, the DoD Component must:</p><p>a.  Take appropriate action necessary to protect the eligible individuals, including removal from their homes.</p><p></p><p>b.  Immediately inform the DoJ Criminal Division of the threat, in accordance with DoJ regulations.</p><p></p><p>c.  Provide the DoJ with the name of each person involved and other pertinent details that may help the Agency determine the degree and seriousness of the threat.</p><p></p><p>d.  Be advised by the DoJ, within 7 days, of the seriousness of the threat and recommend a course of action.  Subsistence payments may begin as soon as the DoD Component invokes the provisions of par. 030705.  If the threatened individual is directed to move into temporary accommodations during the DoJ’s initial 7-day evaluation period, subsistence payments for this period may be allowed, even if the DoJ determines that the threat is not serious or no longer exists and the DoD Component returns the individual to their home.</p><p></p><p>e.  Update the DoJ, at 30-day intervals, of the situation for reevaluation and recommendation, to determine if an extension is necessary.</p><p></p><p>2.  The DoD Component is responsible for deciding each individual case.  The decision is based upon an assessment of the situation and the DoJ’s advice as to whether or not protective action should be initiated or continued and the amount of subsistence and transportation expenses that should be authorized or approved.  When necessary specifically for security reasons, a civilian employee may be authorized or approved to deviate from the approved mode of transportation and the route taken to or from a location away from the civilian employee’s PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  The DoD Component must determine how long allowances continue based on the specific nature and potential duration of the life-threatening situation and the alternative costs of a PCS.  If temporary accommodations are expected to exceed 120 days, the DoD Component should permanently relocate the civilian employee if a PCS is advantageous.  The DoD Component must consider the specific nature of the threat and the continued disruption of the family, as well as the PCS costs.</p><p></p><p>030706.

These deployments are not specifically attached to a combatant command (CCMD) or a joint task force (JTF).  It is the responsibility of the Senior Commander of the deployment to ensure equity of travel and transportation allowances among deployment participants.</p><p></p><p>032701.  Deployment Allowances</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  Service members who participate in routine rotational deployments may be eligible for travel allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  In preparation for the deployment an advance party often arrives at the planned deployment location to ensure operational readiness.  Upon completion of the routine deployment, a rear party remains behind to ensure any actions necessary to vacate the location and end the event are completed.</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation modes are specified in the travel authorization and transportation allowances for the directed mode are as specified in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>3.  Advance parties and rear parties may be authorized the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member on a routine rotational deployment should be in a group travel status with no per diem authorized for the trip to and from the deployment location.  While at the deployment location, these participants are normally in a field duty status and receive no per diem.</p><p></p><p>5.  The Secretary concerned may authorize per diem in par. 020315 when lodging, meals, or incidentals are not provided.</p><p></p><p>6.  The Secretary concerned may authorize a reduced per diem rate as authorized in par. 020315-D4.</p><p></p><p>0328  EXERCISES, MANEUVERS, AND WAR GAMES</p><p></p><p>Exercises, maneuvers, war games and similar events are all types of TDY intended to enhance military readiness.  Advance parties and rear parties (par. 032701) are often used in these events.  These events may involve only one Service or multiple Services, one or more Joint Commands, CCMDs, JTFs, coalition forces from other counties, and any combination of these potential participants.</p><p></p><p>032801.  Exercises, Maneuvers, and War Games Allowances</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member or a civilian employee who participates in field training exercises, practice maneuvers, simulated wartime operations, and JTF exercises (must be field duty) that enhance unit readiness and mission capability are eligible for travel allowances.  The U.S. Coast Guard may be part of a JTF performing exercises, maneuvers, or war games and is eligible for travel allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation modes are specified in the travel authorization and transportation allowances are as specified in Chapter 2 for the mode directed.</p><p></p><p>2.  Advance parties and rear parties may be authorized the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>3.  A participating Service member is normally in a field-duty status.  No per diem is payable when lodging, meals, and incidentals are provided.  However, per diem may be authorized as specified in par. 020315 when lodging, meals, or incidentals are not provided.  If a status other than field duty is designated, then Service members receive the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>4.  A civilian employee is considered in a field duty status.  No per diem is payable when a Government dining facility (including meals ready to eat) and Government-provided lodging are available.  “Government-provided lodging” includes non-transient barracks and tents.  However, a civilian employees are authorized reimbursement for actual costs incurred for meals and lodging during the TDY.  If a status other than field duty is designated, then a civilian employee receives the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>0329  OPERATIONAL DEPLOYMENTS AND CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS</p><p></p><p>The Secretary concerned may direct the use of Government contract quarters, when a Service member is assigned to a contingency operation for 181 or more days at one location, These contracted quarters may be at or near the U.S. installation and are specifically for Service members on the contingency operations.  Directing the use of Government contract lodging off the U.S. installation does not permit directing the use of Government meal rate (GMR), however GMR can be directed when the location is in the AOR.</p><p></p><p>032901.  Reimbursement Options</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member or civilian employee who is temporarily assigned to a CCMD or JTF for operational deployment or contingency operations, and performing duty under similar conditions within the same area of responsibility (AOR), may be eligible for travel allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The CCDR or JTF Commander determines the TDY allowances, as specified in Chapter 2, including designating Essential Unit Messing or field duty, and when personnel travels together with limited or no reimbursement.  The CCDR or JTF Commander must attempt to ensure that travel and transportation allowances in the AOR, and the requirements to receive them, are equitable among eligible travelers within the AOR.</p><p></p><p>1.  The CCDR or JTF Commander may delegate, in writing, the authority to prescribe a different rate for lodging, meals, incidental expenses, or the entire per diem rate to a subordinate commander who directs the travel in individual travel cases.</p><p></p><p>a.  Services must be notified, in writing, of delegations of authority.</p><p></p><p>b.  The CCDR and JTF Commander’s decision about what is payable must be stated in the travel authorization.  The determination of the CCDR and JTF Commander supersedes what the AO puts in the TDY order.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Secretarial Process for each Service may direct a TDY option different than the one used for a CCMD or JTF traveler who is either of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Not located in the CCMD or JTF AOR, but operating in a support capacity.</p><p></p><p>b.  Located in the CCMD or JTF AOR, but not part of the CCMD or JTF.</p><p></p><p>C.  Special Rules for Deployment and Contingency Travel.  If a Service member or civilian employee travels from one TDY location in an AOR to another TDY location within the same AOR, the standard per diem calculation rules in par. 020310-D do not apply.  Instead, the CCDR or JTF Commander for the AOR or contingency operation establishes the per diem rate for the travel day between TDY locations within the AOR.  If the availability of Government quarters and dining facilities changes between the two locations in the AOR, then the per diem is based on the new TDY location when authorized or approved by the CCDR, JTF Commander, or designee. </p><p></p><p>1.  If a Service member or civilian employee travels from one location in an AOR to another location within the same AOR, the per diem does not change unless lodging meals or incidentals are not available and a statement of non-availability is provided.</p><p></p><p>2.  If a Service member or civilian employee is traveling into or out of an AOR, then the rules in Chapter 2 apply for the regular travel days while en route between TDY locations.  See AOR computation example.</p><p></p><p>3.  If a Service member or civilian employee consumes meals at the CCMD or JTF temporary dining facility and is charged the discounted Government meal rate (GMR), reimbursement is for the discounted GMR plus one of the following incidental expense amounts listed in Table 3-16.</p><p></p><p>Table 3-16.  Incidental Expense Amounts</p><p>If…</p><p>Then the incidental expense amount is…</p><p>1</p><p>the traveler is sent TDY to a location in the CONUS,</p><p>$5.00.</p><p>2</p><p>the traveler is TDY to a U.S. installation OCONUS and Government quarters are available on the installation,</p><p>$3.50.</p><p>3</p><p>the CCDR or JTF Commander determines that $3.50 is adequate,</p><p>$3.50.</p><p>4</p><p>the traveler’s TDY location is not a U.S. installation,</p><p>the applicable locality incidental expense rate applies unless the $3.50 is adequate.</p><p></p><p>4.  When a civilian employee is deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq to support ongoing contingency operations, the requirements for a TDY of 181 or more consecutive days do not apply.  The authority to exceed 180 days for this type of a TDY was extended indefinitely by the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&amp;R)) memorandum, “Extended Temporary Duty Assignments to Iraq and Afghanistan,” dated January 6, 2014.  Before travel begins, the travel authorization must cite the February 12, 2008, USD(P&amp;R) memorandum, “Building Increased civilian Deployment Capacity,” as the waiver authority, which does not require Under Secretary of Defense for civilian Personnel Policy review.  This provision also applies to a non-DoD civilian employee if the travel authorization is DoD-funded.</p><p></p><p>032902.  Lodging Reimbursement during an Authorized Absence While TDY in Support of an Operational Deployment or Contingency Operation </p><p></p><p>For allowances when a civilian employee in support of a contingency operation takes leave, see par. 020312.  For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized absence” refers to a period when a Service member is in an authorized leave status or when the Service member’s absence is otherwise authorized under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned (37 U.S.C. §474b(d)).</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member deployed in support of a contingency operation who retains lodging at the TDY location during an authorized absence may be eligible for TDY lodging as a miscellaneous reimbursable expense provided all four of the following criteria are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  TDY in support of a contingency operation for 31 or more days.</p><p></p><p>2.  Performing duty away from home or the PDS immediately before taking the authorized absence.</p><p></p><p>3.  Receiving per diem for lodging expenses.</p><p></p><p>4.  Returns to the TDY location at the end of the authorized absence.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  For authorized absence days, the amount reimbursed for lodging retained at the TDY location depends on the type of per diem the Service member was receiving while TDY.  Per diem is not payable for days at the Service member’s PDS or home.  If the Service member was receiving per diem under the “lodging plus” method, then the lodging reimbursement is limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate at the TDY location.</p><p>  </p><p>032903.  HHG Storage for a Service Member on TDY for an Operational Deployment or Contingency Operation</p><p></p><p>HHG storage for a Service member may be authorized as either “storage in transit” (SIT) or “special storage.”  See par. 020502 for allowances. </p><p></p><p>032904.  POV Storage when a Service Member is TDY for an Operational Deployment or Contingency Operation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member may be eligible to have one POV stored at Government expense when on a contingency operation for 31 or more days.  The storage facility must be a commercial storage facility and the vehicle size must conform to the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command storage contract maximum standard size.  The Secretarial Process may authorize or approve the storage of an oversized POV if the Service member requires the oversized POV for medical reasons. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  An eligible Service member may be authorized or approved the POV storage allowances in Chapter 5.</p><p></p><p>032905.  POV Storage when a Civilian Employee is TCS for an Operational Deployment or Contingency Operation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee or dependent is eligible to have one POV stored at Government expense if the civilian employee is assigned a temporary change of station (TCS) in support of a contingency operation (including humanitarian operations, peacekeeping operations, and similar operations).  The POV must be owned or leased for personal use by the civilian employee or dependent.  The civilian employee must be eligible for TCS allowances and the head of the Agency must determine it to be to the Government’s advantage to authorize POV storage. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  POV storage must be in a commercial storage facility and may be at a place determined to be reasonable by the Agency concerned.  Allowable expenses include POV storage preparation, actual storage cost, and POV preparation for removal from storage after the TCS ends; transportation of the POV to and from the storage facility; and other necessary expenses related directly to POV storage and transportation.  POV insurance costs while in storage are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 3:  TDY TRAVEL</p><p></p><p>PART D: MEDICAL TRAVEL</p><p></p><p>Note:  See par. 020601 for travel to a medical facility in the local area.</p><p></p><p>0330  VARIOUS TYPES OF MEDICAL TRAVEL</p><p></p><p>033001.  Inpatient, Hospitalization, Rehabilitation, and Outpatient</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is an inpatient, in an outpatient status away from the permanent duty station (PDS), or who is assigned to a rehabilitation center, may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances.  An “outpatient status” means that the patient is no longer assigned a bed, but is in a non-leave status.  An outpatient is not medically able to return to duty, but is continuing treatment.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  An inpatient is not authorized per diem while hospitalized.  However, per diem is authorized when in an outpatient status away from the PDS and for days of travel to, from, and between hospitals.</p><p></p><p>2.  An AO may approve reimbursement of occasional lodging when the Service member must retain lodging at the same or a prior TDY location (see par. 020305).</p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member eligible for allowances under the Pay and Allowance Continuation Program receives the incidental expense portion of per diem (see DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 7A, Chapter 13 (Illness or Injury Payment Programs)).</p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member assigned to a rehabilitation center or activity for training or treatment is not authorized per diem when both Government quarters and a dining facility are available.</p><p></p><p>033002.  Emergency Travel Due to Illness or Injury</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee who must discontinue TDY due to illness or injury may be authorized travel and transportation allowances based on the civilian employee’s personal situation and the Service’s or DoD’s mission (see FTR §301-30).</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The civilian employee should contact the AO immediately for instructions when TDY must be discontinued due to illness or injury.  A civilian employee who returns to the PDS or home because of an incapacitating illness or injury is authorized the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.  Allowances for all other eligible travelers follow.</p><p></p><p>1.  Per Diem</p><p></p><p>Note:  Per diem is not allowed at the alternate location.  An “alternate location” is a destination other than the civilian employee’s PDS or the point of interruption where necessary medical services or emergency situations exist.</p><p></p><p>a.  Per diem is authorized for a civilian employee who discontinues the TDY assignment and takes any type of leave due to an incapacitating illness or injury.  However, it: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Must not exceed the per diem rate for the TDY location at which the interruption occurs.</p><p></p><p>(2)  May be continued at the location where the injury or illness occurred, or is being treated, for 14 or fewer days unless authorized by the Service or Department of Defense (DoD) Component.</p><p></p><p>b.  Per diem is not authorized in the following circumstances while a civilian employee is confined to a hospital or medical facility: </p><p></p><p>(1)  In the vicinity of the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  That is the same hospital or medical facility the civilian employee would have been admitted to had the injury or illness occurred at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  If the civilian employee is paid or reimbursed for hospital expenses under any Federal statute, including for hospitalization in a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center or military hospital.  However, the civilian employee receives per diem if medical expenses are paid under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program while in a travel status (5 U.S.C. §8901-§8913).</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation.  A civilian employee who interrupts the TDY and takes leave to travel to obtain medical services at an alternate location and then returns to the TDY may be authorized certain excess transportation costs.  See Table 3-17 to determine excess transportation costs.  Excess transportation costs are not payable for medical services obtained from the nearest hospital or medical facility because it is not considered an alternate location.</p><p></p><p>3.  Attendant or Escort.  An attendant or escort is only authorized transportation expenses, not per diem, to accompany a civilian employee.  An attendant or escort who is neither a Service member nor civilian employee is issued an ITA.  Authorization may include either round-trip or one-way transportation between the PDS and TDY location (B-169917, July 13, 1970).  A medical authority must certify that an attendant is medically necessary.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement.  Reimbursement may be authorized for excess travel costs.  Calculate the excess travel costs by adding the actual travel costs from the interruption point, to the alternate location, and return to the TDY location and subtracting the total from the constructed cost of round-trip travel between the PDS and the alternate location.  The “interruption point” is where a civilian employee discontinues a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury and includes the nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating the civilian employee.

An “unaccompanied duty station” is a permanent duty station to which dependents are not permitted to go with the civilian employee.  A TDY location in an area designated by the Secretary of Defense as a combat zone also qualifies.  The injury or illness must be life threatening or have the potential for permanent life-changing conditions for the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>1.

A Service member is not in a travel status while on an administrative absence.  A civilian employee is not in a travel status while on an excused absence or administrative leave.  See DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 630 (civilian employee leave).</p><p></p><p>033301.  Leave or Personal Travel Combined with Official Travel</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  The AO may permit a Service member or civilian employee to combine leave or personal travel with official travel at no additional cost to the Government provided that:</p><p></p><p>1.  City Pair Program airfare, and other contracted travel rates, are limited to official Government business and not authorized for personal travel.</p><p></p><p>2.  The official transportation is arranged through the Defense Travel Management Office-contracted Travel Management Company.</p><p></p><p>3.  The traveler arranges personal travel at personal expense.</p><p></p><p>4.  The AO does not permit a TDY trip that is an excuse for personal travel.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Table 3-20 provides the travel and transportation allowances available for various combinations of leave and official travel.</p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement is authorized for the actual cost of the transportation used and en route per diem, limited to what the Government’s cost would have been between the official duty locations using a Policy Constructed Airfare (YCA vice CA) had there been no personal travel taken.</p><p></p><p>2.  Economy or coach accommodations must be used unless other accommodations are approved in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>3.  If a travel authorization identifies any location as personal or leave travel, then the authorization must state that any excess costs over the costs for official travel are the traveler’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Table 3-20.  Situations Involving Leave and Official Travel</p><p>If…</p><p>Then the traveler…</p><p>1</p><p>the TDY trip is known before going on leave,</p><p>is reimbursed per diem while at the TDY location.

Reimbursement for transportation expenses is also authorized for the return trip, but limited to the transportation costs that exceed what the traveler would have incurred if no TDY were required (31 Comp. Gen. 509 (1952)).</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler is on leave away from the PDS and the leave is interrupted to perform TDY at various places, with or without a return to the PDS, and the traveler is allowed to resume leave upon TDY completion,</p><p></p><p>is authorized the following:</p><p>a.  Per diem and transportation expenses from the place at which leave was interrupted to the TDY locations.</p><p>b.  Per diem while at the TDY locations, but no per diem while at the PDS.</p><p>c.  Per diem and transportation to return to the place at which the leave was interrupted (25 Comp. Gen. 347 (1945); 28 Comp. Gen. 237 (1948); 39 Comp. Gen. 611 (1960)).</p><p>5</p><p>a traveler is on leave and the leave is interrupted to perform TDY (including TDY at various places) but not including a return to the PDS, and the traveler is allowed to resume leave upon TDY completion,</p><p>is authorized the following: </p><p>a.  Per diem and transportation from the place where leave was interrupted to the TDY locations.</p><p>b.  Per diem while at the TDY locations.</p><p>c.  Per diem and transportation expenses to return to a leave location, which can be different than where leave was interrupted.</p><p>A traveler is allowed per diem and transportation expenses to resume leave at a point more distant from the TDY location than the point at which leave was interrupted, provided the round trip distance and expense are not greater than the distances and constructed travel expense between the traveler&apos;s PDS and the TDY location (27 Comp. Gen. 648 (1948)).</p><p>6</p><p>a traveler’s leave is interrupted for TDY, and the traveler is required to return to the PDS and not allowed to resume leave at the end of the TDY,</p><p>is authorized the following:</p><p>a.  Per diem and transportation from the leave location to the TDY location.</p><p>b.  Per diem while at the TDY location.</p><p>c.  Return travel from the TDY location to the PDS.</p><p>These allowances are limited to the excess cost over the constructed per diem and transportation expense for return directly from the leave location to the PDS.</p><p>7</p><p>a traveler is on leave away from the PDS, and receives orders to go to a TDY location immediately upon completion of leave, and return to the PDS upon completion of the TDY,</p><p>is authorized the following:</p><p>a.

Gen. 977 (1940)).</p><p>8</p><p>a traveler is on leave away from the PDS, receives orders to go to a TDY location immediately upon completion of leave, and return to the PDS upon completion of the TDY, and the traveler must go through the PDS to get to the TDY location, </p><p>is authorized per diem and transportation expenses, limited to the cost of round-trip travel and transportation between the PDS and the TDY location (24 Comp. Gen. 443 (1944)).</p><p>9</p><p>a Service member is recalled from leave to return to the PDS for operational reasons because of an actual contingency or emergency war operation, or because of an urgent and unforeseen circumstance when a substantial portion of the scheduled leave period has been eliminated by the recall or the leave purpose has been defeated (60 Comp.

Per diem is not authorized at the PDS.</p><p>   *Per diem and transportation expenses from the leave location to the PDS may be authorized when the Service member or civilian employee is recalled from leave due to an unforeseen official need.  The travel authorization must state or indicate that the personal expense incurred in traveling to the leave location makes it unreasonable to require the Service member or civilian employee to bear the additional travel expense to comply with the recall or TDY order (39 Comp. Gen. 611 (1960)).</p><p>**A Service member recalled from leave for disciplinary action is not authorized standard travel and transportation allowances under this provision, and is responsible for the costs to return to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>C.  Effect of Leave or Administrative Absence on Per Diem</p><p></p><p>1.  Service Member.  Per diem is not authorized for any day a Service member is not in a travel status or on any day classified as leave or an administrative absence (DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty)).</p><p></p><p>Note:  For long-term TDY, see also par. 032902 and par. 033501.</p><p></p><p>2.  Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>a.  A civilian employee is authorized per diem for a day when leave is taken for only part of the workday.  Per diem is not authorized when leave is taken for the entire workday.</p><p></p><p>b.  A civilian employee may be authorized per diem for leave for up to two non-workdays if leave is taken for all workdays between non-workdays.</p><p></p><p>c.  A civilian employee is not authorized per diem for leave on non-workdays when: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Leave is taken for the whole workday before, and the whole workday following, the non-workday. </p><p></p><p>(2)  The civilian employee returns to the PDS or residence.</p><p></p><p>d.  When a civilian employee is authorized to depart the PDS on a work day to perform authorized TDY the following work day with non-work days in between for personal reasons, per diem is authorized only for the time allowed in the constructed cost of the trip between leaving the PDS and arriving at the TDY point.</p><p></p><p>e.  When a civilian employee chooses not to return to the PDS immediately upon completion of the TDY for personal reasons, per diem is authorized only for the time allowed in the constructed cost of the trip between leaving the TDY point and arriving at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(1)  When constructing the costs of returning to the PDS, if the trip is short or travel is authorized on carriers with sleeping accommodations, then the departure day used to construct the travel costs is the same day that the TDY is completed.</p><p></p><p>(2)  When sleeping accommodations are not available on the authorized transportation mode, the departure date used to construct the travel costs is the morning of the day after TDY is completed.</p><p></p><p>f.  When on leave at a dependent safe haven location, see Chapter 6.</p><p></p><p>g.  See non-workday computation example 1, non-workday computation example 2, and non-workday computation example 3.</p><p></p><p>033302.  Leave Taken while on a TDY with Long-Term Lodging </p><p></p><p>When a traveler rents or leases lodging on a weekly, monthly, or long-term basis, the daily TDY lodging cost is computed by dividing the total periodic lodging cost by the number of days the traveler is authorized the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate (62 Comp. Gen. 63 (1982)).  This computation presumes that the traveler acts prudently in renting by the week or month, and that the Government does not exceed the cost of renting conventional lodging at a daily rate.  See long-term TDY computation example 4.</p><p></p><p>033303.  Ship Relocated During Authorized Absence</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member assigned to a ship who is on leave or liberty when the ship relocates may be eligible for travel allowances if he or she was not notified of the ship’s relocation before departing on leave.  A Service member who was on emergency leave when the ship moved follows the policy in Chapter 4.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member may receive travel and transportation allowances to pay for the additional costs of returning to the ship at its new location, limited to the cost of transportation from the ship’s old location to the new location.</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation in-kind is authorized for transoceanic travel.</p><p></p><p>2.  Government-procured transportation is authorized, but the Service member is financially responsible for all costs above the limit.  City Pair Program airfares are not authorized when the Service member’s transportation cost is higher than the limit.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>0334  PERSONAL EMERGENCIES WHILE ON TDY AWAY FROM THE PDS</p><p></p><p>See DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty) and Service regulations for specifics on situations that warrant emergency leave.  For emergency leave travel associated with medical situations, see Chapter 4.</p><p></p><p>033401.  Service Member Personal Emergency Travel While on TDY</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is on TDY, or assigned to a ship operating away from the home port, and experiences a personal emergency is authorized for travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 are authorized for an eligible Service member to travel round trip from the TDY location, or location of a ship operating away from the home port, to the PDS or home port.</p><p></p><p>1.  When emergency travel to a location other than the PDS or home port is authorized, then the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 are reimbursed.  When round-trip travel occurs, the reimbursement is limited to the costs between the TDY location, or ship operating away from home port location, and the PDS or home port, and return.</p><p></p><p>a.  If it is unnecessary to return to the TDY location, or to the ship operating away from the home port, when the personal emergency is finished, then the Service member is authorized limited return travel and transportation directly to the PDS or home port.</p><p></p><p>b.  If a Service member returns from the emergency leave location to the PDS instead of to the TDY location, then the reimbursement is limited.  The total cost of travel from the TDY location to the emergency leave location and from the emergency leave location to the PDS is limited to the cost had the Service member traveled directly from the TDY location, or ship operating away from the home port, to the PDS or home port.</p><p></p><p>2.  Space-required Government transportation must be used if reasonably available.  A Service member who does not use available Government transportation is not reimbursed for transportation costs.</p><p></p><p>3.  If space-required Government transportation is not reasonably available, then contracted City Pair Program airfares may be used.  If travel to the emergency leave location is more expensive than travel to the PDS or home port, then City Pair Program airfares are not authorized.</p><p></p><p>4.  Authority does not exist for one-way travel and transportation to a ship’s new location if the Service member departed on emergency leave while the ship was in its home port.</p><p></p><p>5.  Per diem is not authorized while the Service member is at the emergency leave location or any time his or her travel status is classified as leave or an administrative absence.</p><p></p><p>033402.  Civilian Employee Personal Emergency Travel While on TDY </p><p></p><p>If a civilian employee interrupts his or her TDY because of an incapacitating illness or injury, see par. 033102.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  Civilian employees who are on TDY away from the PDS or home port and must discontinue or interrupt the mission before completion because of a personal emergency may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The DoD Component may authorize or approve the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 based on the civilian employee’s personal situation and the Service’s or Component’s mission.  This authority may be delegated, but must be held to the highest administrative level practical to ensure adequate consideration and review of the circumstances surrounding the need for the emergency travel.</p><p></p><p>1.  From TDY Location to Home or PDS.  If a civilian employee discontinues his or her TDY and returns home or to the PDS, then transportation expenses and en route per diem may be authorized or approved from the interruption point to the PDS.  The unused portion of the Government-funded transportation for the TDY must be used, if possible.  City Pair Program airfares may be used.  A new TDY order must be issued if the civilian employee returns to the TDY location after the personal emergency is resolved.</p><p></p><p>2.  From TDY Location to Alternate Destination and Return to the TDY Location.  A civilian employee who discontinues his or her TDY and takes leave for travel to an emergency leave location (other than the PDS or from the point at which the civilian employee was notified of the emergency) and then returns to the TDY location, may be authorized or approved certain excess travel costs.</p><p></p><p>a.  The excess travel costs allowed are the excess actual travel costs from the point at which the civilian employee was notified of the emergency, to the emergency leave location, and return to the TDY assignment that exceeds the constructed cost of round-trip travel between the PDS and the emergency leave location.  See  for rules on calculating the excess transportation costs.</p><p></p><p>b.  City Pair Program airfares cannot be used for travel to an emergency leave location and return to the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>c.  If a civilian employee does not have sufficient personal funds to pay for transportation to an emergency leave location and the return trip to the TDY location, then the DoD Component may provide transportation for the civilian employee, or provide an advance of funds to enable the transportation purchase.  The civilian employee must reimburse the Government for any Government-funded transportation cost or travel advance over the authorized or approved allowance.</p><p></p><p>0335  SERVICE MEMBER ON A TDY AFTER EVACUATION</p><p></p><p>033501.  Lodging Expenses for a Service Member on Leave during an Authorized or Ordered Evacuation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is on a TDY and takes leave to travel at personal expense to the safe haven where the dependent is evacuated, may be eligible for a lodging allowance if the Service member meets all of the following criteria:</p><p></p><p>1.  Has an order to the TDY location for 31 or more days.</p><p></p><p>2.  Receive per diem while at the TDY location to cover TDY lodging expenses because Government quarters are not available at no cost to the Service member.</p><p></p><p>3.  Return to the TDY location immediately after completing the authorized leave.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The Service member is authorized reimbursement for lodging retained at the TDY location, during leave, limited to the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate for the TDY location for each day.

Standard Transportation and Reimbursement</p><p></p><p>A.  Standard Transportation.  Transportation authorized in par. 020101 applies to this chapter; however, travelers must use Government transportation for Government-funded leave, when available.  If the command determines that Government transportation is reasonably available and a traveler does not use it, then reimbursement is not authorized.  A commander must determine “reasonable availability” after considering the frequency and scheduling of flights and other relevant circumstances, including those personal to the Service member.  The AO determines the authorized transportation mode if Government transportation is unavailable.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-1.

The personal emergency must be evaluated in accordance with DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty).  Cadets and midshipmen are not eligible for emergency leave transportation.</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member’s domicile is relevant to personal emergency transportation if the Service member is stationed in the continental United States (CONUS).  A “domicile” is a Service member’s home of record, place from which entered (or called) to active duty, place of first enlistment, or permanent legal residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  For an eligible dependent, personal emergencies are circumstances similar to those for which a Service member receives emergency leave travel.  For escort of remains of a deceased Service member, see par. 032001.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-3.

Is command-sponsored and residing OCONUS with the Service member.</p><p>b.  Authorized to reside at a location OCONUS and for whom the Service member receives a station allowance while on permanent duty OCONUS.</p><p>c.  A dependent residing in the CONUS with an emergency leave location OCONUS is eligible for travel allowances only if the Service member is on permanent duty OCONUS or has a domicile OCONUS.  A dependent’s domicile is irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  An eligible Service member or dependent is authorized transportation from locations in Table 4-4.  This applies to a Service member traveling alone or with one or more dependents and one or more dependents traveling without the Service member.  A different destination may be approved through the Secretarial Process.  Return transportation from the destination to the originating location or PDS is authorized if transportation to the destination was under section 0402.  Additionally, travel across the CONUS is at Government expense if the CONUS must be crossed to get to the emergency leave location OCONUS.  See section 0401 for transportation and reimbursable expenses.</p><p></p><p>C.  Authorized Locations.  Origins and destinations that are authorized for an eligible Service member or dependent on emergency leave travel appear in Table 4-4.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-4.

Any airport in the CONUS that is closer to the Service member’s or dependent’s destination if the transportation cost is less than the transportation cost to the international airport closest* to the location from which he or she departed and to which air transportation is available along a normally traveled international route.</p><p>c.  An airport in a non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p>d.  Any foreign location OCONUS, as determined through the Secretarial Process.</p><p>*The closest port of entry in the CONUS is the standard of measure for determining the cost limitation </p><p>(37 U.S.C. §481d).</p><p>See emergency leave computation example 1, emergency leave computation example 2, emergency leave computation example 3, and emergency leave computation example 4.</p><p></p><p>Note:  No authority exists for one-way emergency leave transportation from the CONUS back to a PDS OCONUS if a Service member or dependent is on personal leave in the CONUS when the emergency occurs.  Nor does authority exist for one-way emergency leave transportation from OCONUS back to the CONUS PDS if the Service member or dependent is on personal leave OCONUS when the emergency occurs.</p><p></p><p>0403  EMERGENCY VISITATION TRAVEL (EVT)</p><p></p><p>The reasons for EVT are divided into five categories with varying allowances, requirements, and limitations and are detailed in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p></p><p>040301.  Travel in Response to a Medical Emergency, Eldercare, Death, or Unusual Personal Hardship</p><p></p><p>EVT is not discretionary for travel under this paragraph once the approval authority confirms the need.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee or dependent residing with the civilian employee at a foreign PDS OCONUS is authorized transportation allowances in specific emergency circumstances (10 U.S.C. §1599b; 22 U.S.C. §4081; and 3 FAM §3740 (DoS Foreign Affairs Manual)).</p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee must be a U.S. citizen and have a Service agreement that provides for return travel to the civilian employee’s “actual residence” (see Appendix A).</p><p></p><p>a.  Medical.  Table 4-5 summarizes what a traveler may be authorized.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-5.  Medical Travel</p><p>1</p><p>Authorizing </p><p>or Approval Authority</p><p>AO with the assistance of medical authority, if available</p><p>2</p><p>Authorization</p><p>a.  The civilian employee or the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner can take one round trip to visit an immediate family member who is seriously ill or injured (see par. 040301-B).</p><p>b.  If the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner returns to the PDS from the EVT visit, and the ill or injured family member subsequently dies, then the AO may authorize or approve a second trip.</p><p>3</p><p>Limitation</p><p>of EVT Visit</p><p>One round trip for each serious illness or injury of each family member.</p><p></p><p>(1)  EVT is to visit an immediate family member who is seriously ill or injured, such that death is likely to occur.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The AO must validate that the family member’s condition meets the requirements for EVT.  A civilian employee’s request for EVT for a medical reason must include sufficient information to enable the AO (with the assistance of a medical authority, if available) to determine whether the medical condition of the family member to be visited is severe enough that death is likely to occur.  The request must also include:</p><p></p><p>(a)  Name and address of the family member.</p><p></p><p>(b)  Family member’s relationship to the civilian employee or the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner.</p><p></p><p>(c)  Telephone number and e-mail address, if available, of the attending physician or hospital.</p><p></p><p>(d)  Name, address, and telephone number of a person at the family member’s location who may be contacted about the emergency and that person’s relationship to the family member.</p><p></p><p>(3)  If the family member is located in a foreign area, the AO must request assistance from the nearest PDS or medical facility to validate that the family member’s medical status meets the requirements for EVT.</p><p></p><p>b.  Eldercare.  Table 4-6 summarizes what a traveler may be authorized.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-6.  Eldercare Travel</p><p>1</p><p>Authorizing </p><p>or Approval Authority</p><p>AO</p><p>2</p><p>Authorization</p><p>a.  A civilian employee is limited to two round trips using EVT during his or her lifetime.  The civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner is also limited to two round trips using EVT during the spouse’s or domestic partner’s lifetime.</p><p>b.  The eligible traveler may use both EVT trips to visit one incapacitated parent, or may use one trip for each incapacitated parent.</p><p>3</p><p>Limitation </p><p>of EVT Visit</p><p>Two round trips over the lifetime of each eligible traveler.</p><p></p><p>(1)  EVT for eldercare is authorized when it is necessary to arrange medical care, arrange home care services, evaluate a facility placement, or otherwise assess the need for a new living situation or other form of care for an incapacitated parent when the parent may not be able to live independently.</p><p></p><p>(2)  When requesting EVT for eldercare, the civilian employee must submit a written statement or certification to the AO.  It must contain:</p><p></p><p>(a)  The number of EVT trips already taken by the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner during his or her lifetime for eldercare.  After an individual uses EVT for eldercare for two parents, he or she cannot select any additional parents for EVT purposes.</p><p></p><p>(b)  The name and address of the parent and the care facility, if the parent is under temporary care away from the normal residence.  When the EVT request is authorized or approved, the parent’s identity and the EVT must be recorded in the civilian employee’s personnel record.</p><p></p><p>(c)  A detailed description of the circumstances for which EVT is requested.</p><p></p><p>(d)  Details about the manner in which the person who stood in loco parentis has fulfilled the role in place of a biological, step-, or adoptive parent.</p><p></p><p>(3)  The civilian employee may designate the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner to travel in the civilian employee’s place, or the civilian employee may travel in the spouse’s or domestic partner’s place.</p><p></p><p>c.  Death of an Immediate Family Member.  Table 4-7 summarizes what a traveler may be authorized.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-7.  Travel for Death of an Immediate Family Member</p><p>1</p><p>Authorizing </p><p>or Approval Authority</p><p>AO</p><p>2</p><p>Authorization</p><p>a.  The civilian employee or the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner is limited to one round trip to the place of interment when a family member dies.  Travel must begin as soon as practicable upon notice of the death.</p><p>b.  When a civilian employee or the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner visits a sibling at personal expense, and the sibling dies within 45 calendar days of when the traveler departed from the foreign PDS, then the traveler may elect either reimbursement for the round-trip visit already taken at personal expense or EVT round-trip transportation for the sibling’s interment.</p><p>3</p><p>Limitation </p><p>of EVT Visit</p><p>One round trip and travel must begin as soon as practicable following death notification.</p><p></p><p> (1)  EVT is authorized for the interment of a civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner; child (including a stepchild or adopted child) or individual who is or was under legal guardianship of the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner; parent of the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner, or a brother, stepbrother, sister, or stepsister of the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Either the civilian employee or the civilian employee’s spouse or domestic partner may be eligible for EVT, but not both.</p><p></p><p>d.  Death of a Civilian Employee or Dependent.  Table 4-8 summarizes what a traveler may be authorized.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-8.  Travel for Death of a Civilian Employee or Dependent</p><p>1</p><p>Authorizing </p><p>or Approval Authority</p><p>AO</p><p>2</p><p>Authorization</p><p>When a civilian employee or dependent dies in a foreign location, regardless of whether death occurs at the PDS or elsewhere in a foreign area, each of the civilian employee’s dependents is authorized to accompany the body anywhere in the world.</p><p>3</p><p>Limitation </p><p>of EVT Visit</p><p>One round trip to the place of interment for each eligible dependent who resides at the civilian employee’s PDS.</p><p></p><p>e.  Unusual Personal Hardship.  EVT may be authorized for a civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner who has exceptional circumstances that require emergency family visitation for reasons other than visiting an ill or injured family member, death of a family member, or care of an incapacitated parent.  Table 4-9 summarizes what a traveler may be authorized.  Requests must be supported by a statement from the civilian employee, detailing the exceptional circumstances.  Documentation must:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Include the nature of the circumstances and any available documentation relating to the circumstances of the request.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Include the statement: “I [declare, certify, verify, or state] under the penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.  Executed on [date].  [Signature]”.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-9.  Travel for Unusual Personal Hardship</p><p>1</p><p>Authorizing </p><p>or Approval Authority </p><p>Individual delegated authority by the DoD Component concerned</p><p>2</p><p>Authorization</p><p>Each DoD Component establishes general criteria that warrant approval of EVT in exceptional circumstances for a civilian employee or a spouse or domestic partner residing with the civilian employee at a foreign PDS.</p><p>3</p><p>Limitation </p><p>of EVT Visit</p><p>One round trip from PDS to EVT location and return.</p><p></p><p>2.  The civilian employee or one dependent, but not both, is authorized EVT for a qualifying emergency.  In exceptional circumstances, the AO may authorize or approve additional family members for EVT travel.  Exceptional circumstances may include when:</p><p></p><p>a.  A critical injury occurs to a dependent child attending school away from the PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee or dependent dies at the PDS and the remains are being returned for interment in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>c.  A nursing child needs to accompany the mother, or a preschool child needs to accompany a single parent.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee is ineligible for EVT when either of the following situations occurs:</p><p></p><p>a.  The emergency travel is wholly within the foreign PDS area or country.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee is not at the foreign PDS OCONUS on one of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Leave in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Temporary duty in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>4.  A dependent is ineligible for EVT when the emergency travel is wholly within the foreign PDS area or country.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  An eligible civilian employee or dependent is authorized round-trip transportation from a foreign PDS to the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.  In certain family emergencies, the AO may approve another location.  See section 0401 for transportation and reimbursable expenses.  The provisions below apply to each traveler.</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation</p><p></p><p>a.  Transportation is authorized from the eligible civilian employee’s PDS to the CONUS or a non-foreign OCONUS location of the seriously ill, injured, or deceased dependent, or for eldercare.</p><p></p><p>(1)  Use special or discounted fares offered for a short, round trip (excursion fares) with restrictions, such as minimum and maximum stays, to the maximum extent possible.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Indirect routing may be authorized only when a civilian employee is performing official duties en route or when it is to the Government’s advantage to purchase a ticket in foreign currency at an intermediate point.</p><p></p><p>b.  When a civilian employee is on leave in a foreign location, or an eligible family member is in a foreign location away from the civilian employee’s PDS, EVT allowances are limited to the Government’s cost for traveling between the PDS and the EVT destination.</p><p></p><p>c.  If the destination is in a foreign location, then reimbursement is limited to the transportation costs that would have been incurred between the civilian employee’s PDS and actual residence.  The only exception is if the traveler is using EVT to visit a person in a foreign location who is there because of the civilian employee’s assignment at the foreign PDS.  In such case, reimbursement is for the actual cost of transportation.</p><p></p><p>d.  A civilian employee must repay the Government-paid or Government-reimbursed EVT expenses when EVT is used as a substitute for travel for purposes for which EVT is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>2.  Travel Before Authorization.  The civilian employee or the civilian employee’s eligible spouse or domestic partner may travel before the AO authorizes the EVT.</p><p>a.  Personally incurred transportation expenses may be reimbursed if the travel is approved after the fact.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Government may provide transportation for EVT justified by medical reasons or for eldercare after the traveler executes a repayment acknowledgment.  The repayment acknowledgment must include:</p><p></p><p>(1)  “I certify that I have read and understand Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Chapter 4, section 0403, and related JTR sections, and that all expenditures made by the Government in connection with my emergency visitation travel, [or emergency visitation travel of my eligible spouse or domestic partner, [Name]], shall become my personal financial responsibility.  These expenditures are subject to collection as an overpayment in the event that approval of such transportation is determined to be unwarranted under the provisions in section 0403.  If I do not repay these funds immediately upon demand, I understand that the Government may pursue collection of these funds through deductions from salary, allowances, lump payments, or any other remedy.”</p><p></p><p>(2)  The civilian employee’s signature.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee is financially liable for any expenditure not approved and must repay the cost of any transportation provided by the Government if the travel is determined to have been unwarranted under the conditions governing EVT.</p><p></p><p>d.  In 30 or fewer calendar days after travel is completed, the EVT traveler must provide a written certification to the AO detailing the name, address, and relationship to the traveler of the person visited.  The certification must:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Detail the circumstances that necessitated the EVT, including any illness, health conditions, or other circumstances at the time of travel that met the requirements for EVT.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Attach a report from the attending physician or hospital, describing the nature of the dependent’s illness at the time of travel.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Detail the parent’s health status when travel is for eldercare.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Detail the exceptional circumstances requiring the EVT.</p><p></p><p>(5)  Include the signed and dated statement:  “I [declare, certify, verify, or state] under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.”</p><p>e.  Based on the statement and supporting documentation that the civilian employee, spouse, or domestic partner provides, the AO determines if the travel satisfied all of the requirements for EVT.</p><p></p><p>(1)  If the travel meets the EVT requirements, then the AO issues the appropriate travel order for the EVT.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If the travel does not meet the requirements, then the AO notifies the civilian employee or dependent that the conditions did not satisfy the requirements for EVT.  The civilian employee may request reconsideration by providing the AO additional supporting documentation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3.  EVT Affects Other Types of Travel.  See Chapter 5 for the effect of EVT on RAT and Chapter 6 for the effect on family visitation travel.</p><p></p><p>C.  Funding.  The civilian employee’s command funds the EVT and reimburses the authorized expenses.  The civilian employee is financially liable for any expenditure not authorized or approved.  For information about charging leave, see DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 630 (civilian employee leave) and DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 1260 (civilian employee home leave).</p><p></p><p>0404  FUNDED ENVIRONMENTAL AND MORALE LEAVE (FEML)</p><p></p><p>The FEML policy is established for a Service member in DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty).  This policy is adopted and used for civilian employees.  </p><p></p><p>040401.  FEML Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member or a civilian employee may be eligible for FEML if he or she is stationed at an authorized FEML PDS for 24 or more consecutive months (10 U.S.C. §1599b and 22 U.S.C. §4081(6)).  The required 24 months can include a 12-month tour that is extended for an additional consecutive 12 months.  FEML is not discretionary for travel under this paragraph when an individual meets eligibility requirements, unless otherwise prohibited in this regulation.</p><p></p><p>2.  A dependent is eligible for FEML when residing with the Service member or civilian employee serving an accompanied tour, if the Service member’s dependent is command-sponsored or the civilian employee’s dependent is authorized.  A student attending school away from the PDS is considered to be residing with the Service member or civilian employee in terms of FEML eligibility.  An authorized dependent may travel separately or alone, even if the Service member or civilian employee elects not to travel.</p><p></p><p>3.  FEML may be combined with other official travel or another funded-leave transportation program.  However, each traveler is eligible to take only the number of trips authorized in Table 4-10.  Receiving dual allowances or comparable allowances from another Agency is not allowed.  When two eligible Service members or civilian employees reside in the same household at the FEML PDS, each is authorized only one FEML trip.  Any eligible dependent or family member who qualifies for FEML under both of the Service members or civilian employees may receive only one of the allowances.  Similarly, if an eligible traveler’s transportation is funded by a host government in a way that is comparable to FEML, the traveler is not eligible for a FEML trip.</p><p></p><p>4.  The number of FEML trips an eligible traveler may take depends on the Service member’s or civilian employee’s tour length, as shown in Table 4-10.  A Service member executing an in-place consecutive overseas tour (IPCOT) is authorized additional FEML trips based on Table 4-10, as is a civilian employee who signs a tour-renewal agreement.  No more than two FEML trips are authorized for any overseas tour, including extensions to that tour.</p><p></p><p>5.  The time frame for FEML travel is set closer to the middle of an eligible tour by limiting the number of months after it begins or before it ends when a traveler can use FEML.  However, on a case-by-case basis, a Combatant Commander (CCDR) may waive the following three-month rule and six-month rule.  FEML must be performed before the traveler completes his or her tour of duty (CBCA 1067-TRAV, June 26, 2008) and:</p><p></p><p>a.  Should not be performed within three months of the beginning or end of a 12-month extension to a tour that previously was at least 24 months long but less than 36 months.</p><p></p><p>b.  Should not be performed within six months after the beginning or six months before the end of a 24- or 36-month tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>Table 4-10.  FEML Trips Authorized by Assignment Length and Tour Extension</p><p>Tour Length</p><p>FEML Trips Authorized</p><p>1</p><p>At least 24 months, but less than 36 months</p><p>1</p><p>2</p><p>Tour extended at least 12 months</p><p>1 additional</p><p>3</p><p>New tour assignment at least 24 months, but less than 36 months</p><p>1 additional*</p><p>4</p><p>At least 36 months</p><p>2</p><p>5</p><p>Tour extended for any length of time</p><p>0 additional</p><p>6</p><p>New tour assignment at least 24 months</p><p>1 additional*</p><p>7</p><p>New tour assignment at least 36 months</p><p>2 additional*</p><p> *A new tour assignment, such as a Service member’s IPCOT or when a civilian employee signs a renewal agreement, starts the number of FEML trip authorizations over.  When a traveler on a 12-month tour to a FEML location without a dependent extends for a consecutive second 12-month tour, the traveler is only eligible for one funded-leave transportation program: COT travel (Service member only), RAT (civilian employee only), or FEML.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  An eligible traveler is authorized transportation from an authorized FEML origin to an authorized FEML destination.  See  Funded Environmental and Morale Leave (FEML) Locations and Destinations.  This site also specifies the authorities designated to certify a place as a FEML location or destination.  A Service member or dependent and a civilian employee or family member may travel together or separately during FEML.  Eligible travelers may not use cruise or tourist packages to or from the authorized destination.  See section 0401 for transportation and reimbursable expenses.</p><p></p><p>1.  Alternate Destination(s) Transportation.  An eligible traveler may select an alternate destination location, or multiple destination locations, rather than the one listed at Funded Environmental and Morale Leave (FEML) Locations and Destinations, and be reimbursed transportation up to the cost of Government-procured transportation between the FEML PDS and the authorized destination.</p><p></p><p>a.  An eligible student attending school away from the PDS may be authorized FEML to join the family at the authorized FEML location or alternate destination.  The Government-funded transportation costs from the school to the designated FEML location or alternate destination must not exceed the Government’s cost had the dependent traveled from the PDS to the authorized FEML location.</p><p></p><p>b.  See FEML computation example 1 and FEML computation example 2.</p><p></p><p>2.  FEML Repayment.  A civilian employee must repay the Government-paid or Government-reimbursed FEML expenses when he or she does not complete the tour for reasons other than:</p><p></p><p>a.  A compassionate transfer.</p><p>b.  A management initiated transfer.</p><p></p><p>c.  An involuntary separation that is no fault of the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>d.  Training needs.</p><p></p><p>e.  A new assignment that shortens the length of the current tour, disqualifying FEML eligibility for a trip that was previously authorized and completed.</p><p></p><p>0405  TRAVEL FOR REST AND RECUPERATION (R&amp;R) LEAVE</p><p></p><p>Regular R&amp;R leave and Special R&amp;R (SR&amp;R) leave policy is established in DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty).  This policy is adopted and used for civilian employees.  A dependent or family member is ineligible for R&amp;R leave transportation.</p><p></p><p>040501.  R&amp;R Leave</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member or a civilian employee on a tour of duty for 12 months or more is eligible for R&amp;R leave transportation when assigned to an authorized location OCONUS.  See Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) Locations and Destinations.</p><p></p><p>B.  Combined Leave and Travel.  R&amp;R leave can be combined with liberty, administrative absences, TDY, or travel for other purposes only when the Service member or civilian employee requests it.  The CCDR or designated representative, who must be at least a General Officer or Flag Officer, may authorize the combined travel if it is in the Government’s best interest.  Travelers may be eligible for additional R&amp;R leave transportation depending upon the tour of duty identified in Table 4-11.</p><p></p><p>C.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  An eligible traveler receives transportation allowances for round-trip travel between the authorized duty location and an authorized R&amp;R destination.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Pakistan uses Table 4-13.  </p><p></p><p>3.  An eligible traveler may not use cruise or tourist packages to or from the authorized destination.  </p><p></p><p>4.  See section 0401 for transportation and reimbursable expenses.  </p><p></p><p>5.

See section 0401 for transportation and reimbursable expenses.  See FEML computation example 1 and FEML computation example 2.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART A:  STANDARD PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION ALLOWANCES (SERVICE MEMBERS)</p><p></p><p>0501  INTRODUCTION</p><p></p><p>This part includes PCS rules for travel by a Service member, travel by a dependent, local travel, and shipment and storage of belongings.  It also covers the eligibility for types of standard PCS allowances:  transportation, per diem, miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, dislocation allowances (DLA), and temporary lodging expenses (TLE).  The standard travel and transportation rules, in Chapter 2, apply unless otherwise indicated in this chapter.  Also see Tour Lengths and Tours of Duty OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>050101.  PCS Transportation Allowance</p><p></p><p>A.  Transportation Options.  The amount of reimbursement depends upon the mode of transportation the Service member or dependent chooses to use, if not otherwise directed or authorized.  Transportation allowances are for travel directly from the old PDS to the new PDS, or between authorized points in the JTR.  Multiple options are available for arranging and paying for transportation, subject to the limitations in this chapter.  Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing a monetary allowance in lieu of transportation (MALT).</p><p></p><p>1.  Government transportation.</p><p></p><p>2.  Government-procured commercial transportation.</p><p></p><p>3.  Personally procured commercial transportation.</p><p></p><p>4.  Privately owned transportation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Using Mixed-Mode Transportation.  If more than one mode of transportation is used between official points, this is mixed-mode travel (see Appendix A definition).  A Service member or dependent may use more than one mode of transportation.  </p><p></p><p>050102.  PCS Per Diem Allowance</p><p></p><p>This section addresses per diem allowances to and from official travel locations.  The amount of reimbursement is determined by the mode of transportation authorized and used, the official distance, the number and age of dependents authorized to travel, and whether a dependent is traveling with the Service member.  Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing per diem allowances. </p><p></p><p>050103.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses</p><p></p><p>See Chapter 2 for information about miscellaneous reimbursable expenses.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>050104.  Dislocation Allowance (DLA) </p><p></p><p>A DLA partially reimburses a Service member for expenses incurred in moving a household.  The household move must be required by a PCS, ordered for the Government’s convenience, required due to an evacuation, or otherwise authorized in section 0505.  A DLA is a flat amount and may be paid as a primary DLA, a secondary DLA, or a partial DLA, depending upon the circumstances of the household move.  A DLA is mandatory when the conditions in this chapter are met.  Only one DLA is permitted in a fiscal year, unless the situation qualifies as an exception in par. 050501.</p><p></p><p>050105.  Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) </p><p></p><p>A TLE is an allowance designed to partially reimburse a Service member for the cost of lodging and meals when he or she or a dependent occupies temporary lodging in the continental United States (CONUS) during a PCS move.  Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing TLE allowances. </p><p></p><p>050106.  Pet Quarantine Incident to a PCS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member on a PCS order is authorized reimbursement for mandatory pet quarantine fees for household pets.  A household pet is a cat or a dog.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Reimbursement for actual mandatory household pet quarantine fees is authorized, limited to $550 per PCS move. </p><p></p><p>C.  General Pet Information.  See Pet Quarantine Information. </p><p></p><p>D.  Pet Transportation.  Transportation for a household pet is not a reimbursable expense, except when transportation is incident to an evacuation from a foreign PDS in accordance with par. 060204.</p><p></p><p>0502  PDT TRANSPORTATION</p><p></p><p>050201.  Transportation Types Most Advantageous to the Government for PCS Travel</p><p></p><p>A.  Privately Owned Vehicle (POV).  A POV is advantageous for use by a Service member or dependent.  However, a Service can restrict POV use within its own regulations and may allow AOs to include these restrictions on PCS orders.  An AO cannot restrict a Service member or dependent from using a POV on a PCS move unless a Service regulation contains the restriction.  See par. 050203, when transoceanic travel is involved.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Government Transportation.  Government or Government-procured transportation is advantageous for transoceanic travel by a Service member or dependent. </p><p></p><p>050202.  Airplane, Train, Ship, and Bus Transportation </p><p></p><p>A Service member or dependent must use the Travel Management Center (TMC) for PDT.  The standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 apply, unless otherwise indicated in this chapter.</p><p></p><p>A.  Commercial.  Reimbursement of personally procured transportation is limited to what the Government would have paid had the Service member or dependent purchased the ticket through the TMC for authorized transportation over a usually traveled and direct route (see “policy-constructed airfare” in Appendix A). </p><p></p><p>B.  Government.  An AO may direct a Service member or a dependent to use Government transportation. </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member or dependent who, for personal reasons, uses a transportation mode other than the mode directed is not reimbursed for transportation costs. </p><p></p><p>2.  The AO must authorize or approve any reimbursement for excess accompanied baggage when a Service member or dependent uses Government transportation . </p><p></p><p>C.  Air Travel Medically Inadvisable.  When air travel is medically inadvisable for a family member:</p><p></p><p>1.  The family should not be separated unless the family members agree to be separated, or military necessity requires the Service member to travel separately.</p><p></p><p>2.  Surface transportation by the least costly commercial train or ship passenger accommodations must be used.</p><p></p><p>3.  The provisions directing a Service member to use Government or Government-procured transportation do not apply. </p><p></p><p>D.  Travel by Oceangoing Car Ferry</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member or dependent traveling by POV partly by road and partly by car ferry may be authorized transportation allowances.  Only a passenger automobile, light truck, or similar vehicle used primarily for personal transportation, regardless of size, may be authorized for passage on the car ferry.  The cost of a POV transported on a car ferry with the Service member or dependent does not constitute POV shipment.  It is considered a reimbursable transportation expense. </p><p></p><p>a.  MALT is authorized for the official distance from the old PDS to the car ferry port of embarkation and from the car ferry port of debarkation to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The traveler is authorized Government-procured ferry transportation, or reimbursement for personal transportation costs on the car ferry (including any part of the costs related to POV movement, limited to the Government-procured ferry transportation cost).  </p><p></p><p>c.  If the same POV is used for more than one trip, the MALT and car ferry fees apply for each trip.  When a Service member is authorized or approved reimbursement for using more than two POVs, MALT and car ferry fees are authorized for each POV.</p><p></p><p>2.  A U.S. flag car ferry must be used, if available.  See par. 020206 for U.S. flag carrier requirements.  </p><p></p><p>3.  If POV transportation aboard an oceangoing car ferry at Government expense results in excess transportation costs, these costs are not collected from the Service member. </p><p></p><p>E.  Directed Travel over other than a Usually Traveled Route.  When a Service member is ordered to travel over a route involving a higher cost to the Government because the travel order is amended or modified while he or she is en route, then a Service member is authorized allowances over the ordered route. </p><p></p><p>F.  Pet Transportation.  When a traveler chooses transportation that is more expensive than the lowest Government-contracted airfare because he or she is transporting a pet, then the traveler is financially responsible for the additional costs. </p><p></p><p>050203.  Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)</p><p></p><p>A Service member or dependent who uses a POV may be authorized MALT.  MALT is based on the official distance in par. 020204, when traveling on a PCS order between any of the official points in Table 2-2.  A rental car used for PCS travel is considered a POV.  Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing MALT.  The MALT rate in effect on the date PCS travel commences applies even if travel is completed after the rate changes.  See Chapter 2 for POV use to or from a transportation terminal or PDS, or miscellaneous reimbursable expenses associated with POV transportation. </p><p></p><p>A.  Transoceanic Travel</p><p></p><p>1.  POV.  An AO may authorize a Service member or dependent to use a POV on a route normally involving transoceanic travel if it is to the Government’s advantage.</p><p></p><p>a.  This provision only applies if the POV is used for the entire distance between the official points in par. 020205.  This applies regardless of whether reimbursement exceeds other transportation modes. </p><p></p><p>b.  If the Service member or dependent does not use a POV for the entire distance as authorized and instead uses mixed-mode transportation, then reimbursement is limited to the actual transportation cost or the policy-constructed POV cost, whichever is less. </p><p></p><p>2.  Privately Owned Boat.  A Service member or dependent who travels by privately owned boat may be reimbursed for either the policy-constructed airfare or the actual cost for fuel, oil, and docking fees, whichever is less. </p><p></p><p>B.  Multiple Travelers</p><p></p><p>1.  Passengers in a POV.  When more than one traveler on official orders uses the same POV, only one traveler may receive reimbursement for MALT and POV-related reimbursable expenses.  All other travelers in the same vehicle are considered passengers and receive no transportation reimbursement.  See PDT computation example 7.</p><p></p><p>2.  Use of More than One POV.  A Service member authorized travel for a dependent can be reimbursed when they use two POVs.  More than two POVs used for PDT within the same household may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 5-1.  Use of More than One POV</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a Service member and dependent relocate on a PCS move and use two POVs, </p><p>reimbursement is authorized for each vehicle to include car ferry fees for each POV.</p><p>2</p><p>a Service member does not use a POV and the dependents use two POVs,</p><p>reimbursement is authorized for each vehicle.</p><p>3</p><p>more than two POVs are authorized,</p><p></p><p>4</p><p>the same POV is used to transport the Service member or dependent for more than one trip between the old PDS and new PDS,</p><p>reimbursement is authorized for each official trip.</p><p>5</p><p>more than two licensed drivers are in the family, the family has more than two POVs, and this is the only reason additional POVs are requested, </p><p>reimbursement is authorized for only two POVs.</p><p>Examples of when More Than Two POVs are Routinely Authorized or Approved</p><p>6</p><p>The number of family members, including their luggage, cannot be transported in two vehicles.</p><p>7</p><p>A dependent requires special accommodations due to physical conditions or age-related restrictions and two POVs are required for the Service member or dependent.</p><p>8</p><p>A Service member must report to the new PDS before the dependents and the delayed travel is for reasons acceptable to the AO, such as school-term completion or personal business-affairs settlement and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p>9</p><p>The dependents perform unaccompanied travel between authorized points other than those that the Service member uses, such as travel to a designated place or to the new PDS while the Service member has a TDY en route, and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p>10</p><p>The dependents perform unaccompanied travel to the new PDS before the Service member’s reporting date for reasons acceptable to the AO, such as to enroll dependents in school at the beginning of the term, and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p></p><p>050204.  Indirect or Circuitous Travel To, From or Between OCONUS Points</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member or dependent who performs PCS travel to, from or between OCONUS points over an indirect or circuitous route at personal expense and convenience is authorized travel allowances unless he or she was directed to use Government transportation and did not use it when it was available.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member may receive the following travel allowances, limited to the amount he or she would have been authorized had travel been via the direct route between the old PDS and new PDS:</p><p></p><p>1.  MALT plus flat per diem (MALT Plus) for land travel performed from the time the Service member or dependent departs the old PDS until the Service member reports to, or the dependent arrives at, the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Reimbursement for the cost of transoceanic U.S. flag transportation used and per diem.</p><p></p><p>3.  Reimbursement for transoceanic travel on non-U.S. flag transportation in </p><p>par. 020206.</p><p></p><p></p><p>050205.  Authorized Travel Time </p><p></p><p>A.  Travel Time Rules.  A Service member or dependent is authorized travel time to complete a PDT move.  The Department of Defense (DoD) Component determines the authorized arrival and departure date, but the AO computes the authorized travel time using the official distance, the mode of transportation authorized, and the transportation used.  The distance from the home, office, or residence to the local transportation terminal is not considered when computing travel time.  Compute the maximum authorized travel time for PDT as if travel were performed using a POV. </p><p></p><p>1.  If the ordered travel is 400 or fewer miles between official points and the traveler uses a POV, Government automobile, or rental vehicle, then 1 day of travel is authorized for the official distance.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the distance is greater than 400 miles, then divide by 350 to determine the number of authorized travel days.  If the remainder is 51 or more, one additional travel day is allowed.  The result determines the maximum number of authorized travel days.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-2.  Authorized Travel Time Rules</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>authorized travel by commercial air,</p><p>one day is allowed in the CONUS and within areas outside the CONUS (OCONUS).</p><p>2</p><p>the Government purchases commercial air, train, or bus transportation,</p><p>the authorized travel time is the actual time needed to travel over the direct route, including necessary delays.</p><p>3</p><p>traveling by commercial train,</p><p>compute the authorized travel time using the scheduled departure and arrival dates.</p><p>4</p><p>a traveler using an airplane, train, or bus chooses to travel by a transportation mode other than the one authorized,</p><p>use the actual travel time, limited to the travel time for the authorized mode of transportation.</p><p>5</p><p>the time between the departure date and the arrival date (elapsed time) is less than the authorized travel time,</p><p>the elapsed time is the basis for the payment.</p><p>6</p><p>a Service member is reassigned between activities at the same PDS,</p><p>no travel time is allowed.</p><p>7</p><p>a PCS order is modified, canceled, or revoked after travel has begun,</p><p>travel time is allowed between the same points used to determine the Service member’s allowances.</p><p>8</p><p>a Service member travels to a local transportation terminal from the home, office, or residence,</p><p>this travel is not included in the determination of authorized travel time.</p><p>9</p><p>a Service member has a TDY en route,</p><p>travel time is the time allowed for the authorized mode of transportation between official points.</p><p>10</p><p>the elapsed time is more than the authorized travel time, such as when the traveler takes leave, </p><p></p><p>11</p><p>a PCS is a unit move and a Service member is not escorting a dependent,</p><p>compute the travel time for the authorized mode of transportation.</p><p>12</p><p>a PCS is a unit move and a Service member is on an accompanied tour, </p><p></p><p>13</p><p>a PCS is a unit move and a Service member escorts a dependent to or from a designated place while changing duty locations to or from an unaccompanied tour OCONUS, </p><p>compute the Service member’s travel time for the authorized mode of transportation to the new PDS.  The following legs of the trip are limited to the policy-constructed travel time as if the travel had been performed by Government-procured transportation:</p><p>a.  The return trip after escorting the dependent from the old PDS to the designated place.</p><p>b.  The trip from the new PDS in the CONUS to the designated place to retrieve the dependent upon conclusion of the unaccompanied tour OCONUS.</p><p>14</p><p>a POV delivery or pick-up is separate from en route PCS travel, </p><p>par. 020302 applies.</p><p>15</p><p>the PCS involves two afloat units or an afloat unit and a shore activity, </p><p>use the unit’s location on the departure date or the planned location at the arrival date to determine travel time.  This is subject to correction after the fact if either point changes.</p><p>See PDT computation example 1</p><p></p><p>B.  Mixed-Mode Travel.  When travel is by mixed-mode transportation, compute the maximum number of days authorized as though a POV was used.  Travel between the duty location and local terminal, or between local terminals is not considered.  To compute mixed-mode travel time, the following computation applies:</p><p></p><p>Table 5-3.  Computation for Mixed-Mode Travel*</p><p>1</p><p>Determine the official distance between the authorized separate legs of the journey in par. 020205.  If the distance is 400 or fewer miles, 1 day of travel is allowed.  If the distance is greater than 400 miles, then divide by 350 to determine the number of authorized travel days.  If the remainder is 51 or more, one additional travel day is allowed.  The result determines the maximum number of authorized travel days.</p><p>2</p><p>Determine the actual number of miles a POV was used between the official points (the distance traveled to a leave point is included).  If this is greater than the official distance in Step 1, then the authorized travel is the same as in Step 1 and no further computation is required.  If the distance is less than what was allowed in Step 1, then divide by 350.  If the excess distance is 51 or more miles, one additional travel day is authorized.</p><p>3</p><p>Allow 1 day for travel by air, train, or bus transportation.</p><p>4</p><p>Add Step 2 and Step 3 together, to determine the authorized travel time.</p><p> *When computing the authorized travel time, do not include travel while at the leave point, old PDS, new PDS, or TDY location, or when traveling from a leave point and returning to the same leave point.</p><p>PDT computation example 2 (no leave involved)</p><p>PDT computation example 3 (leave involved)</p><p></p><p>C.  Transoceanic Travel Time.  The actual time required for transoceanic travel by aircraft or ship, over a usually traveled direct route, is authorized.  The embarkation or debarkation day at the terminal or port while awaiting transportation is included, regardless of the arrival or departure hour </p><p></p><p>D.  Additional Travel Time.  A Service member may request additional travel time for reasons beyond his or her control.  The commanding officer may authorize or approve the actual time used or a shorter period than requested.  Per diem is payable for any day additional travel time is authorized.  The commanding officer may require additional documentation supporting the circumstances. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>0503  PCS PER DIEM</p><p></p><p>The specified per diem rates apply for all related travel unless otherwise authorized or restricted in the JTR.  This includes but is not limited to necessary delays awaiting further transportation, delays at the port of embarkation or port of debarkation, and a TDY en route.  Calculate travel time for en route per diem payments using the lesser of either the authorized travel time or the actual travel time.  If the travel includes crossing the International Date Line, see par. 020314 and the PCS examples for additional computation guidance.  When residence relocation is unnecessary because the PCS is a short distance move, no MALT Plus is authorized unless the Service member is ordered to perform a TDY en route. </p><p></p><p>050301.  PCS Per Diem when Traveling by POV</p><p></p><p>Table 5-4.  PCS Per Diem Rules when Traveling by POV (MALT Plus)</p><p>If a Service member uses a POV…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>between authorized points, </p><p>MALT Plus at the standard CONUS per diem rate is paid for each authorized travel day.  Any Service member traveling on an official PCS order in a POV may receive MALT Plus.</p><p>2</p><p>and uses Government quarters or dining facilities while traveling between authorized locations, </p><p>there is no impact to the MALT Plus calculation. </p><p>3</p><p>and takes leave in connection with a PCS, or has a TDY en route, </p><p>MALT Plus is authorized for the allowable travel time between official points of the journey.</p><p>4</p><p>on any day that Lodging Plus, in par. 020310, and MALT Plus could both apply, such as the arrival day at a TDY location or point of embarkation, </p><p>for that day, apply the rules in par. 020310.  The day cannot be considered an authorized travel day for MALT Plus.  Although per diem in the situation is paid using the Lodging Plus rules, the transportation is still paid at the MALT rate.  </p><p></p><p>050302.  PCS Per Diem when Traveling by Airplane, Train, Ship, or Bus </p><p></p><p>Table 5-5.

If travel ends on the debarkation day, then the rate used is the locality per diem rate for the new PDS.</p><p>e.  If travel does not end on the debarkation day, the rate used is the locality per diem rate for the Service member’s or dependent’s location at 2400 on that day.  The Service member or dependent is authorized MALT Plus beginning the day after the debarkation day from the car ferry if travel by POV continues on the day after the debarkation day from the car ferry. </p><p>5</p><p>by oceangoing car ferry and is not required to spend the night on the car ferry,</p><p>the M&amp;IE rate is MALT Plus while on the car ferry. </p><p>6</p><p>by commercial ship and meals are furnished without charge or are part of the accommodations cost</p><p>Per diem is not authorized except on embarkation and debarkation days.  On those days, the locality per diem rate for the port of embarkation or port of debarkation, as appropriate, applies. </p><p></p><p>050303.  PCS Per Diem for Dependents</p><p></p><p>A.  Per Diem Rates.  When dependent travel is authorized, per diem is payable for travel directly from the old PDS to the new PDS (see Table 5-6).</p><p> </p><p>Note:PCS allowances are not authorized for dependent travel to, from, or while at an en route TDY location.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-6.

Per diem is calculated at 50% for each dependent traveling with the first dependent for direct travel between the old and new PDS.</p><p>  *See Table 5-7 for the effect of the dependent’s age on per diem.</p><p>**Dependents use different routes or travel at different times.</p><p>See PDT computation example 5</p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Age and Eligibility.  Eligibility for dependent travel and transportation allowances is based on whether the individual is a dependent on the effective date of the PCS order.  If an individual is not a dependent when travel begins, then there is no authorization for travel and transportation allowances at Government expense unless specifically authorized within the JTR.  The timing of when a dependent child reaches 12 years of age impacts the per diem rate paid.  Table 5-7 specifies how to determine the dependent’s age for payment of travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-7.

Travel by Commercial Ship.  Per diem is not authorized when traveling aboard a commercial ship when meals are furnished without charge or are part of the accommodations cost, except on embarkation and debarkation days. </p><p></p><p>0504  STANDARD DEPENDENT TRAVEL ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>050401.  Time Limit</p><p></p><p>A Service member’s authority for dependent travel and transportation allowances may be used while the PCS order remains in effect, before receipt of a new PCS order to another PDS, unless specifically restricted in the JTR.  This includes receipt of a home port change announcement.  However, dependent travel must be because of the Service member’s PCS and not for personal reasons. </p><p></p><p>050402.  Funds Advance and When Transportation Documents or Funds are Lost or Stolen</p><p></p><p>A.  Funds Advance.  A Service member authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances may receive an advance of funds for the allowances.  A Service member authorized dependent transportation in connection with a separation or relief from active duty may be advanced an amount equal to 75% of the MALT.  However, if a Service member fails to complete at least 90% of the initial active duty obligation and is separated from the Service or relieved from active duty under section 0510, the advance is limited to 75% of the amount for the least costly available transportation mode.  A Service member authorized dependent travel and transportation upon retirement is authorized a funds advance. </p><p></p><p>B.  Transportation Documents or Funds are Lost or Stolen.  A dependent traveling on a PCS order at Government expense who is stranded en route because documents or funds needed to purchase authorized transportation were lost or stolen may be furnished transportation-procurement documents in accordance with Service regulations.</p><p></p><p>050403.  Dependent Travel before an Order is Issued </p><p></p><p>This paragraph does not apply to travel for an early return of a dependent, for evacuation travel, or for travel under section 0508.</p><p></p><p>A.  General.  Ordinarily, travel that occurs before an order is issued is at personal expense and no reimbursement is authorized.  However, a Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances for dependent travel that occurs before a PCS order is issued but after the Service member has been advised that such an order would be issued.  The Service member must be otherwise eligible for dependent travel and transportation allowances.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Conditions.  General information provided to the Service member concerning order issuance before the determination is made to actually issue the order (such as time of eventual release from active duty, when the service-term expires, retirement eligibility date, or expected rotation date) is not advice that an order will be issued.  Any travel voucher for travel occurring before a PCS order is issued must be supported by a statement from the PCS AO or designated representative, that the Service member was advised that the order would be issued, and must cite this paragraph as authority for payment.  Transportation must not be provided before a PCS order is issued. </p><p></p><p>050404.  Deferred Dependent Travel </p><p></p><p>If a Service member chooses not to move a dependent when he or she is authorized to do so, the dependent travel and transportation allowances for an eligible dependent are payable during a subsequent PCS, as indicated below. </p><p>A.  The allowance is for the actual travel to the new PDS.  However, the allowance is limited to the greater of the distances from one of the following locations to the new PDS:</p><p></p><p>1.  Home of record (HOR) or place where last entered or called to active duty (PLEAD), unless the dependent was moved to the HOR or PLEAD in connection with a move to a non-PDS location.</p><p></p><p>2.  Designated place.</p><p></p><p>3.  PDS from which the Service member elected not to move the dependent.</p><p></p><p>4.  Last PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Any interim PCSs for which the Service member did not claim dependent travel and transportation allowances are ignored.</p><p></p><p>050405.  When Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances are not Payable </p><p></p><p>A.  No Allowances Authorized.  5-8 contains three columns specifying the situations when dependent travel and transportation is not authorized.  Reasons related to travel OCONUS are contained in section 0508.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are not authorized in the following circumstances or in Table 5-8:</p><p></p><p>1.  Between points otherwise authorized in section 0504 to a place where they do not intend to establish a permanent residence, including pleasure trips.  For PCS travel of a student, the student’s permanent residence when not living with the Service member while at school is the Service member’s PDS, or the designated place of the Service member’s other dependents if they are not authorized to reside with the Service member.</p><p></p><p>2.  For transoceanic transportation or land transportation OCONUS when the Service member is without dependents, as defined in Chapter 9, unless a Service member is assigned to a COT and is to serve an accompanied tour at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  To a PDS OCONUS when a Service member’s unexpired term of service is less than the specified tour, unless he or she voluntarily extends the term of service to permit completion of the specified tour or the Secretary concerned grants an exception to the normal tour on an individual case basis.</p><p></p><p>4.  To a TDY location when a Service member is assigned to an indeterminate TDY (ITDY). </p><p></p><p>Table 5-8.  Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances are not Authorized</p><p>Traveler</p><p>Not Authorized Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances</p><p>1</p><p>Service Member</p><p>a.  A cadet or midshipman.</p><p>b.  Assigned to a school or installation as a student, if the course of instruction is less than 20 weeks (except as in section 0322).</p><p>c.  A Reserve Component (RC) enlisted member called or ordered to initial active duty for training for less than 6 months. </p><p>d.  Called or ordered to active duty for training for:</p><p>(1)  139 or fewer days when the active duty for training period intended in an order  is for 139 days or less, except as in section 0322.</p><p>(2)  140 or more days when the active duty is at more than one location, but less than 140 days, except as in section 0322, at any one location.</p><p>e.  Called to active duty for reasons other than training for:</p><p>(1)  180 or fewer days.</p><p>(2)  181 or more days when the active duty is at more than one location, but 180 or fewer days at any one location.</p><p>(3)  181 or more days at one location, but authorized per diem in section 0303.</p><p>f.  Absent Without Leave.</p><p>g.  A Deserter or Straggler.</p><p>h.  Dropped or dismissed.</p><p>i.  Transferred as a prisoner to a detention facility.</p><p>j.

Is a Service member on active duty, on the PCS order’s effective date (see section 0509 for travel and transportation allowances after the spouse is no longer on active duty).</p><p>b.  Is not a dependent, except as in par. 050409, on the PCS order’s effective date.  Allowances when a spouse separates or retires from the Service after the Service member’s PCS order’s effective date and when a dependent’s travel and transportation is due to an IPCOT are unaffected.  Receives any other Government-funded travel and transportation allowances for this travel.</p><p>c.  Is a Service member’s or spouse’s parent, stepparent, or person in loco parentis, who does not reside in the Service member’s household, unless otherwise authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  The exception to this is for a dependent listed in this table who was transported at Government expense to a PDS OCONUS as an eligible dependent, but who no longer qualifies as a dependent and is returned to the CONUS at Government expense.</p><p>d.  Is a dependent child who is not in the Service member’s legal custody and not under his or her control on the PCS order’s effective date.  See section 0512 for travel authorization when legal custody or control changes after the PCS order’s effective date.</p><p></p><p>B.  Only Per Diem Authorized</p><p></p><p>1.  Per diem is payable for any part of a journey that a U.S. flag air carrier or ship is available, but a dependent uses foreign flag transportation.  </p><p></p><p>2.  Per diem is payable when dependent transportation is made available (whether used or not) by a foreign Government, at no cost to the United States or the Service member, under a contract or agreement with the United States.</p><p></p><p>050406.  Service Member Attains Eligibility for Dependent Travel </p><p></p><p>A Service member, ineligible for dependent travel and transportation allowances to a new PDS under Table 5-8, who later attains eligibility, is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances on the next qualifying PCS.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-9.  Allowances for a Service Member Who Attains Eligibility for Dependent Travel</p><p>If a Service member is on active duty at a…</p><p>And…</p><p>Then the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances …</p><p>1</p><p>location in the CONUS to which dependent travel is authorized </p><p>attains eligibility for dependent travel and transportation allowances while at that location,</p><p>on the Service member’s next qualifying PCS in or to the CONUS.  Unless otherwise specified in the JTR, travel is authorized from the dependent’s location on the date the PCS order was received, limited to travel from the PDS where the Service member attained eligibility to the new PDS or to another authorized location.  </p><p>2</p><p>location OCONUS to which dependent travel is authorized, and attains eligibility for dependent travel and transportation allowances while at that location </p><p>a.  the dependent is command-sponsored,</p><p>for the dependent’s travel on the Service member’s next PCS OCONUS if the Service member has at least 12 months remaining on the tour OCONUS at that location after the dependent is scheduled to arrive, unless otherwise exempted.  Travel authorization is from the dependent’s location on the PCS order receipt date, limited to the authorization for travel from the PDS where the Service member attained eligibility to the new PDS or to another authorized location.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>b.  the dependent is not command-sponsored,</p><p>for the dependent’s travel on the Service member’s next PCS OCONUS, until the dependent obtains command-sponsorship.  The Service member is not authorized dependent transportation for transoceanic travel from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS CONUS, if the dependent was not command sponsored at the PDS OCONUS or qualifies as a Service member with dependents as defined in par. 090101-E.  The acquired dependent is authorized travel from the CONUS port to the new CONUS PDS at Government expense.</p><p>3</p><p>dependent-restricted tour area </p><p>the Service member becomes eligible for travel and transportation allowances while at that location,</p><p>for the dependent only upon a PCS to a PDS where dependent travel and transportation is authorized.  If the new PDS is OCONUS, the dependent must be command-sponsored before the AO authorizes allowances to the new PDS.  Travel is authorized from the dependent’s location on the date the PCS order was received to the new PDS or to another authorized location.  This is limited to the travel to the new PDS from the location where the dependent remained, or moved to at personal expense, when the Service member was transferred to the dependent-restricted tour area.  The Service member is not authorized dependent transportation for transoceanic travel from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS CONUS, if the dependent was not command sponsored at the PDS OCONUS or qualifies as a Service member with dependents as defined in par. 090101-E.  The acquired dependent is authorized travel from the CONUS port to the new CONUS PDS at Government expense. </p><p></p><p>050407.  Dependent Temporarily Absent from the Old PDS, Designated Place, or Safe Haven when a PCS Order Is Received </p><p></p><p>The Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the old PDS, designated place, or safe haven to the new PDS, if the dependent returns to the old PDS, designated place, or safe haven and travels from there to the new PDS (B-195643, April 24, 1980).</p><p></p><p>050408.  Travel and Transportation Involving Locations Other Than the Old or New PDS </p><p></p><p>This paragraph does not apply to travel to or from a designated place.  For this paragraph, the place where the dependent resides and from which the Service member commutes daily to the PDS is treated as his or her PDS location.  A Service member in receipt of a PCS order is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the place where the dependent resides to the new PDS, or from the old PDS to the new place where the dependent will reside, limited to the authorization from the old to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>050409.  Spouse Separates or Retires from the Service after the Effective Date of a Service Member’s PCS Order </p><p></p><p>When a Service member married to a Service member travels on a PCS order and his or her spouse separates or retires from the Service after the PCS order’s effective date, he or she is authorized dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances for that spouse.  This is limited to the cost for travel from the separated or retired spouse’s last PDS to the Service member’s PDS on that PCS order.</p><p></p><p>050410.  Escort for a Dependent  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  Escort travel is authorized only when the AO determines that dependent travel is necessary and that the dependent is incapable of traveling alone due to age, physical or mental incapacity, or other extraordinary circumstance.  The Service member’s AO or commanding officer may appoint an escort for the dependent.  An escort for a dependent may be authorized for any of the following reasons: </p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member cannot accompany a dependent.  A dependent is authorized an escort within the 1-year period after the Service member dies, is declared missing, is injured, or is otherwise unable to accompany the dependent.  A Service member, civilian employee, or another person may serve as an escort.</p><p></p><p>2.  Concurrent dependent travel to the new PDS is not permitted by the Secretary concerned for a sole parent or a Service member married to another Service member.  Round-trip travel and transportation is authorized for a Service member who serves as an escort for the dependent, once command-sponsorship is granted.  If Government transportation is not available, then transportation in section 0502, is authorized.  The following Service members may serve as an escort for the dependent:</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member who is a sole parent, but not another person.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member married to another Service member, but not both.</p><p></p><p>B.  Escort Allowances.  A Service member escort under this paragraph is authorized round-trip TDY travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.  A civilian employee escort, under this paragraph, is authorized the TDY travel and transportation allowances in regulations issued by the Agency or Department that is funding the travel.  A person other than a Service member or civilian employee, designated to travel as an escort for a dependent, is issued an Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA) (see section 0305).  This individual is authorized the same transportation and travel allowances as a civilian employee on TDY.  See Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA).</p><p>Note:See par. 050804 for an escort associated with an early return of a dependent.</p><p></p><p>050411.  Dependent Joins or Accompanies the Service Member during TDY En Route </p><p></p><p>A.  Basic Allowance.  When a dependent accompanies or joins a Service member performing TDY en route between two PDSs, the dependent’s travel and transportation allowances are as specified in this paragraph.  The Service member’s travel time and the amount of per diem paid for the Service member’s PCS travel are not used in computing the per diem for dependent PCS travel.  Compute travel time as specified in par. 050205.  No per diem is authorized for the dependent while at the TDY location.  The Service member is authorized PCS allowances for the actual dependent travel performed limited to the greater of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  MALT for the official distance between authorized points as if the dependent had traveled separately, plus a per diem for the constructed travel time between the authorized points.</p><p></p><p>2.  What it would have cost if Government-procured transportation had been used for travel between authorized points, plus a per diem as in Chapter 2 for the time required for travel between authorized points.  If Government-procured transportation is used, then subtract the Government-procured transportation cost from the allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Travels with the Service Member in the Same POV.  The MALT rate applies for the official distance from the old PDS to the TDY location and then to the new PDS.  No additional MALT is authorized for the dependent travel.  The per diem rate in par. 050303, applies when the dependent travels with the Service member for the allowable travel time for that leg of the journey.</p><p></p><p>C.  Dependent Travels in a Separate POV.  The MALT rate applies for the Service member’s travel from the old PDS to the TDY location and then to the new PDS.  The Service member also is paid the MALT rate for the dependent’s direct travel from the old PDS to the new PDS.  The per diem rate in par. 050303, applies when the dependent travels separately from the Service member for the allowable travel time for that leg of the journey.</p><p></p><p>0505  DISLOCATION ALLOWANCE (DLA) </p><p></p><p>The purpose of DLA is to partially reimburse a Service member for the expenses incurred while relocating his or her household under the circumstances in this section.  This section includes rules when the Service member is considered to be with or without a dependent or is married to another Service member.  It also includes situations when a secondary DLA or partial DLA (par. 050508) is warranted.  DLA may be paid in advance.</p><p></p><p>050501.  Fiscal-Year Limitations </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is eligible for a DLA, with or without a dependent, must follow the fiscal-year requirements below.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member is authorized only one DLA payment during a fiscal year unless one of the following occurs (37 U.S.C. §477):</p><p></p><p>1.  Payment is made for partial DLA.</p><p>2.  The Secretary concerned determines that the Service’s requirements warrant more than one PCS during the current fiscal year.  The authority listed in Table 5-10, may authorize additional DLA payments.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-10.  Authority for Exceptions to Fiscal Year Limitations</p><p>Service </p><p>or Agency</p><p>Service Secretary’s Delegated Authority</p><p>1</p><p>USA, USN,  USAF</p><p>No lower than a General or flag officer at the headquarters level who directs assignments.</p><p>2</p><p>USMC</p><p>No lower than an O-6 at the headquarters level who directs assignments.</p><p>3</p><p>USCG</p><p>To the Commander of the USCG Personnel Service Center.</p><p>4</p><p>NOAA Corps</p><p>To the Director of the NOAA.</p><p></p><p>3.  The Service member is on a PCS to, from, or between a course conducted, controlled, and managed by one or more of the Services.</p><p></p><p>4.  The eligible dependent is relocated to a designated place due to an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>5.  The Service member’s household is moved due to a national emergency or in time of war.</p><p></p><p>6.  The Service member or a dependent is moved under any of the following circumstances:</p><p></p><p>a.  PCS order is amended, modified, canceled, or revoked . </p><p></p><p>b.  Service member is reported as dead or absent for 30 or more days and in a missing status.</p><p></p><p>c.  Early return of dependents.</p><p></p><p>7.  The household is moved due to a base realignment and closure (BRAC).</p><p></p><p>8.  The Service member is ordered to a unit undergoing a change of home port for commissioning, outfitting, or overhaul, or because a shore unit is undergoing a change in PDS.</p><p></p><p>9.  A Service member’s dependent relocates due to the Service member being assigned to ITDY.</p><p></p><p>C.  Determining Fiscal-Year Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  To determine the fiscal year in which DLA authority occurs, use the Service member’s departure or detachment date from the old PDS in accordance with the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>2.  Exclude PCS moves in the same fiscal year for which a DLA was not authorized when determining if the fiscal-year limit applies to a DLA payment.</p><p></p><p>3.  Except under the conditions in par. 050501-B3, par. 050501-B6, and par. 050501-C2, all PCS moves, including those approved by the Secretary concerned, are counted to determine if the statutory limitation applies.</p><p></p><p> </p><p>050502.  Service Member with or without a Dependent</p><p></p><p>The amount payable for a DLA is usually based on whether the Service member has a dependent.  The allowances in this paragraph apply regardless of if the Service member has a dependent.  A Service member may be eligible for DLA in any of the following circumstances:</p><p></p><p>A.  Short-Distance Move.  The Service member is authorized a short-distance HHG move at Government expense: </p><p></p><p>1.  From a private-sector residence to another private-sector residence, for the Government’s convenience, when proper authority directs the Service member to vacate local housing because the residence does not meet the Service’s health and sanitation standards.  This does not apply to moves to or from privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>2.  Due to a PCS to a new PDS that is in proximity to the old PDS or when reassigned between activities at the same PDS (42 Comp. Gen. 460 (1963)). </p><p></p><p>B.  PCS Order Due to A Change in Service.  A Service member is separated or relieved from active duty from one Service to continue on active duty in another Service without a break in service under the authority of 10 U.S.C. §716, or any similar statutory provision is eligible for a DLA when the household move is due to a PCS order resulting from a change of Service.  The service performed after such separation is a continuation of the prior period of service. </p><p></p><p>050503.  Service Member with a Dependent </p><p></p><p>For DLA purposes, a Service member with a dependent is one who, on the effective date of a PCS or ITDY order, has a dependent who is authorized transportation under that order.  If the spouse is a dependent on the effective date of the order, the Service member is a Service member with a dependent even if the spouse received travel allowances upon separation from the Service as a former Service member.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member with a dependent is authorized a DLA when:  </p><p></p><p>1.  The dependent relocates in connection with a PCS.  </p><p></p><p>2.  The dependent relocates in connection with an official alert notification before the Service member receives a PCS order to a PDS OCONUS where dependent travel is not authorized.  The Service member becomes eligible for the DLA once the PCS is completed. </p><p></p><p>3.  The Service member performs a PCS between PDSs not in proximity to each other, or relocates due to an ITDY order, but the dependent makes a proximity move based on the PCS order or ITDY order.  For the Service member to be eligible for a DLA, he or she must provide one of the following: </p><p></p><p>a.  A statement that the household move was necessary as a direct result of the PCS or ITDY from the new PDS commanding officer or from that commanding officer’s designated representative.  The designated representative cannot re-delegate this authority.</p><p></p><p>b.  A statement that the move was necessary as a direct result of the PCS or ITDY when the PCS is to or from a dependent-restricted tour.  In this case, the commander’s statement is not required and the Service member’s statement must be accepted.  </p><p></p><p>4.  A dependent moves because a Service member is reported as dead or absent for 30 or more days in a missing status.  </p><p></p><p>5.  One or more dependents returns early from a PDS OCONUS at Government expense.  The Service member is authorized a DLA either the day the first dependent arrives at the permanent residence location or the day all of the dependents have departed the PDS overseas, whichever event occurs later.  The Service member is ineligible for a DLA if the dependent is authorized to return to the Service member’s PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>6.  The dependent makes an authorized move to or from a PDS OCONUS in connection with a tour change from accompanied to unaccompanied, or from unaccompanied to accompanied, at the same PDS OCONUS after the initial tour of duty completion. </p><p></p><p>7.  A dependent completes travel to or from a designated place due to a PCS order or an evacuation order.  When a dependent completes travel to a designated location due to a PCS order, no other DLA is payable for that PCS unless the Service member’s tour changes after the initial tour of duty completion and a dependent travels. </p><p></p><p>8.  The Service member is ordered to move due to a BRAC Commission action and, as a result, the dependent moves. </p><p></p><p>9.  A dependent moves in connection with an ITDY order. </p><p></p><p>10.  The Service member relocates the household when he or she transfers from OCONUS, or inside the CONUS, to a hospital in the CONUS for observation and treatment.  A statement of prolonged hospitalization is required from the receiving hospital’s commanding officer when the Service member transfers to a hospital in the CONUS from inside the CONUS. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  If the dependent moves with the Service member, DLA at the with-dependent rate is paid.  When a dependent is authorized to travel, but does not move with the Service member, DLA at the without-dependent rate may be paid, provided Government quarters are not assigned at the new PDS.  If the dependent later joins the Service member and travels at Government expense, the difference between the without-dependent rate and the with-dependent rate may be paid. </p><p></p><p>050504.  Service Member Considered to be without a Dependent for DLA</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member has no dependents.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member may be eligible for a DLA and would be considered without a dependent when he or she:</p><p></p><p>a.  Has a dependent who is authorized travel and transportation allowances in connection with a PCS but the dependent does not relocate (59 Comp. Gen. 376 (1980)).</p><p></p><p>b.  Is not authorized travel and transportation allowances for a dependent to relocate either in connection with a PCS or to a new PDS.</p><p>B.  Allowances.  A DLA is authorized when a Service member is:</p><p></p><p>1.  Ordered and moves to a new PDS where Government quarters are not assigned.</p><p></p><p>2.  Ordered to a new PDS where Government quarters are assigned and occupied upon arrival at the new PDS for 60 days or less.

A Service member on a PCS living in temporary lodging in the vicinity of the old or new PCS location, home of record, initial technical school, or a designated place may be eligible for a TLE allowance for lodging and meal expenses.  The lodgings occupied must be a temporary residence, not a permanent one.  TLE is an allowance intended to partially pay a Service member for lodging and meal expenses incurred while occupying temporary lodging in the CONUS upon a PCS.  TLE may not cover all of the lodging and meal expenses incurred.  Table 5-12 lists eligibility criteria for TLE and some of the situations when a Service member would be ineligible.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-12.

At any location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances1.  A Service member may be reimbursed TLE for any day that per diem is not reimbursed for authorized travel time between PDSs.  If a Service member has 8 days elapsed time (e.g., proceed, delay and travel) between PDSs and the allowable travel time is 7 days, the Service member may be paid one day of TLE during the elapsed time if spent near the old or new PDS.  The additional available TLE days may be reimbursed for days spent:</p><p>a.  Near the old PDS before (or after) the member checked out of the activity at the old PDS,</p><p></p><p>b.  At a designated place (Appendix A) en route,</p><p></p><p>c.  Near the new PDS before (or after) the member checked into the activity at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member may be authorized TLE for either 5 or 10 days, depending on whether the new PDS location is in the CONUS.  The days may be split between multiple authorized locations and at the Service member’s or dependent’s discretion.  Table 5-13 specifies the number of days a Service member is authorized based on location.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-13.

TLE may be temporarily increased for up to 60 days for a PCS move to a new PDS in the CONUS if the location was jointly approved by the Service Secretaries because the new PDS in the CONUS is in a Presidentially declared disaster area or is experiencing a sudden increase in the number of Service members assigned there.  The Secretaries set the dates when the additional days for TLE are effective.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-14.

TLE is reimbursed at the locality per diem rate of the PDS, designated place, home of record, or initial technical school where the Service member occupies temporary lodging.</p><p></p><p>a.  Government quarters must be used, if available, before commercial lodging and is subject to the rules outlined in Table 5-16.  A Service member is not required to use Government quarters that are available in the vicinity of the designated place.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-16.  Criteria for TLE for Government Quarters</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>Government quarters are available at the old or new PDS and the Service member chooses to stay in other lodgings,</p><p>reimbursement is limited to the Government quarters cost or the locality lodging rate, whichever is lower. </p><p>2</p><p>Government quarters are not available,</p><p>the Service member is required to obtain a non- availability confirmation number provided by the Service’s lodging reservation process to justify reimbursement for commercial lodging.</p><p>3</p><p>family-type Government quarters are not occupied because they are under renovation, or HHG has been packed, picked up, and shipped, but not received by the Service member, or HHG has not been shipped from the old PDS,</p><p>reimbursement for commercial lodging is authorized.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member and his or her dependent may be reimbursed up to a maximum of $290 per day and may occupy temporary lodging on the same or different days up to the authorized number of days.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member may elect the days for which TLE is claimed.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If the Service member and his or her dependent claim TLE on different days, then TLE is reimbursed as if the lodging was occupied on the same day.</p><p></p><p>(3)  TLE is calculated based on the locality per diem rates, the number of dependents and their ages, and the actual lodging expenses.</p><p></p><p>c.  The steps to the calculation are on DTMO’s website.  When determining the daily lodging ceiling and M&amp;IE rate, multiply the percentage in Table 5-17 by the applicable locality per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-17.

Each dependent then increases the percentage for the Service member claiming that dependent.  Both Service members cannot claim the same dependent for TLE on the same days.  Each member may be reimbursed up to $290 per day.</p><p></p><p>(2)  For a Service member with multiple dependents occupying the same temporary lodging, add each dependent starting with the oldest dependent to get the correct percentage rate.  A Service member with two dependents, one over 12 and one under 12 is 125%.</p><p></p><p>(3)  When a Service member or dependent stay with friends or relatives, no lodging reimbursement is authorized.  The TLE meal portion is payable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>050602.  Advance of TLE</p><p></p><p>An advance may be paid for the average number of days that TLE is paid in connection with a PCS to a PDS.  The average number of days that TLE is paid is determined through the Secretarial Process.  If the new PDS is in the CONUS, the advance is limited to the maximum amount for 10 days.  If the new PDS is in OCONUS, the advance is limited to the maximum amount for 5 days.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART B:  CATEGORIES OF PDT (SERVICE MEMBERS)</p><p></p><p>This Part includes major categories of travel for a permanent change of station (PCS), including accession and training travel, moves outside the continental United States (OCONUS), home port and retirement and separation.

Who is rejected or who is accepted and ordered to return home to await further orders or a reporting date.  The PCS allowances are from the place where the applicant was transported at Government expense to the home or the place at which the application was made.</p><p></p><p>2.  Services may issue regulations that require the applicant to use Government-procured transportation or meal tickets.  If the applicant does not use Government-procured transportation or meal tickets, and the AO accepts the applicant’s reason for not doing so, then transportation costs are reimbursed at the TDY POV mileage rate for the official distance and costs for personally purchased occasional meals and lodging are reimbursed.  If the AO does not accept the applicant’s reason for not using required Government-procured transportation or meal tickets, then he or she is not reimbursed. </p><p></p><p>050703.  Service Academy Cadets and Midshipmen </p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member Enters a Service Academy.  An active-duty enlisted Service member entering a Service academy is authorized standard PCS allowances from the last PDS to the Service academy.  A person other than an enlisted Service member who is entering a Service academy is authorized standard PCS allowances from the home or school to the Service academy.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Graduate Ordered to Active Duty.  When commissioned and ordered to active duty, a graduate of a Service academy is authorized PCS allowances from the Service academy or home to the new PDS, via any TDY en route locations.  PCS allowances are calculated based on the actual distance traveled, limited to what would have been paid based on the official distance from the Service academy or home to the first PDS via any TDY en route locations designated in the travel order.</p><p></p><p>C.  Dependent Travel.  The Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances to the new PDS or designated location, as appropriate.  When a Service member gains a dependent after his or her departure or detachment date from a Service academy on an active duty PCS order, but on or before the PCS order’s effective date, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances to the new PDS from the HOR, the Service academy, or the place at which the individual becomes a dependent.  If the dependent travels to the HOR or Service academy before the active duty PCS order’s effective date, then the allowances are from the HOR or Service academy, whichever one the dependent traveled to. </p><p></p><p>050704.  Service Member Assigned to a Foreign Service College </p><p></p><p>A Service member assigned to a Foreign Service college on a PCS for 20 or more weeks is authorized standard PCS travel and transportation allowances.

Attaining or Losing Eligibility for Dependent Travel for PCS OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A dependent must be command-sponsored before he or she begins travel for the Service member to be eligible for reimbursement of dependent travel at Government expense to, between, or from a location OCONUS except as in Table 5-9.  A Service member must meet the standard eligibility requirements in section 0504, and have at least 12 months remaining on the tour of duty OCONUS from the arrival date of a dependent at the PDS OCONUS, unless otherwise exempted.  Table 5-19 specifies allowances when a traveler no longer qualifies as a dependent.  Travelers listed in Table 5-19 must complete travel within 6 months after the Service member completes personal travel from the PDS OCONUS due to a PCS (see par. 051104 if a Service member entitled to basic pay dies while on duty OCONUS).</p><p>Table 5-19.  Dependent Travel Eligibility for PCS OCONUS</p><p>1</p><p>Qualified Travelers No Longer Dependents</p><p>The following travelers transported OCONUS at Government expense who no longer qualify as dependents:</p><p>a.  Parent.</p><p>b.  Stepparent.</p><p>c.  Person in loco parentis.</p><p>d.  An unmarried child who turns 21 years old.</p><p>e.  An unmarried child who turns 23 years old and loses student status while the Service member is serving OCONUS,</p><p>2</p><p>Travel and Transportation Allowances</p><p>Allowances are for travel from the PDS OCONUS to one of the following appropriate locations determined through the Secretarial Process:</p><p>a.  United States or a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p>b.  The former dependent’s native country if he or she is foreign-born.</p><p></p><p>050804.  Early Return of Dependents (ERD)</p><p></p><p>This section applies to situations when a command sponsored dependent, who is at a PDS OCONUS, returns to a designated place at Government expense before the Service member receives official notice of a PCS from the PDS OCONUS (DoDI 1315.18 (Military Personnel Assignments)).  </p><p></p><p>A.  Reasons for Return.  The return must be caused by one of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  An official situation.</p><p></p><p>2.  A matter of national interest.</p><p></p><p>3.  A personal situation at the PDS OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>4.  Disciplinary action is taken against a Service member stationed OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent’s Travel Order.  A dependent must begin travel before the Service member is issued a new PCS order from the PDS OCONUS, except for travel for disciplinary reasons.  The AO must cite the specific reason for the authorization or approval in the dependent’s travel order.  For disciplinary action, travel and transportation allowances are limited to the cost from the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS or the place to which the dependent was last transported at Government expense, as applicable, to the designated place or, if the dependent is foreign-born, to the dependent’s native country.  If the Service member is convicted by court martial and placed on leave involuntarily while awaiting completion of an appellate review, allowances are limited to the cost to the Service member’s home of record or PLEAD.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member may return a dependent at personal expense (at Government expense if the Service member serves an in-place consecutive overseas tour (IPCOT)) to the location OCONUS from which the dependent traveled.  If that dependent is again command-sponsored, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the PDS on the subsequent PCS. </p><p></p><p>2.  The Secretary concerned may delegate authority for ERD travel. </p><p></p><p>C.  Designated Place Location.  The dependent may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process to travel to a designated place in the CONUS, a non-foreign area OCONUS or, if the dependent is foreign born, to a designated place in the dependent’s native country.  The Secretary concerned may authorize a dependent who is a foreign national to return to his or her foreign country origin, even when the Service member is stationed within that country.  The Secretary concerned may delegate the authority for travel to a foreign-born dependent’s native country to the headquarters that directs the Service’s dependent transportation policies or procedures.  The official authorizing the transportation determines the destination and ensures that a reasonable relationship exists between the destination, conditions, and circumstances when the early return is due to any of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  A foreign national returning to his or her native country.</p><p></p><p>2.  An official situation, national interest, or a personal situation.</p><p></p><p>3.  Disciplinary action against the Service member stationed OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Official Situations.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances in this paragraph are in addition to, and have no effect on, the Service member’s dependent travel allowances on the next PCS order’s effective date.  Table 5-20 specifies the eligibility and allowances for ERD associated with official situations.</p><p></p><p>1.  The Secretary concerned may delegate this authority to either of the following:  </p><p></p><p>a.  The headquarters that directs the Service’s dependent transportation policies and procedures for travel to a foreign-born dependent’s native country.</p><p></p><p>b.  The installation commander, who is an O-5 or higher, or the commanding officer of the unit to which the Service member is assigned, for designated places in the CONUS or in a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-20.  Early Return of Dependents (ERD) for Official Situations</p><p>If the dependent…</p><p>And is involved in an incident that is any of the following:</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>is command-sponsored and resides at the Service member’s current PDS OCONUS</p><p>a.  embarrassing to the United States,</p><p>b.  prejudicial to the command’s order, morale, and discipline,</p><p>c.  facilitates conditions in which the dependent’s safety can no longer be ensured due to adverse public feeling in the area or due to force protection and antiterrorism considerations,</p><p>d.  requires the dependent to register as a sex offender under the laws of any jurisdiction, </p><p>dependent travel and transportation allowances may be authorized at PCS rates through the Secretarial Process to a designated location.  </p><p>2</p><p>was command-sponsored at an old PDS OCONUS and remains there while the Service member serves a dependent-restricted tour at another PDS OCONUS</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>is a foreign-born dependent who was moved at Government expense to the dependent’s native country while the Service member serves a dependent-restricted tour at a PDS OCONUS</p><p></p><p></p><p>2.  A dependent whose early return was caused by an incident that was an embarrassment to the United States or prejudicial to the command’s order, morale, and discipline cannot move again at Government expense until the Service member is ordered on a PCS from the PDS OCONUS or serves an IPCOT. </p><p></p><p>3.  Return travel to the PDS OCONUS is not authorized at Government expense unless the incident requiring the early return was because the dependent’s safety could not be ensured due to adverse public feeling in the area or due to force protection and antiterrorism considerations.  </p><p></p><p>4.  If the dependent returns to the PDS OCONUS at personal expense, and is then command-sponsored, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the PDS OCONUS on the next PCS. </p><p></p><p>E.  National Interest</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A command-sponsored dependent at a location OCONUS may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances when the Secretary concerned or more senior official determines that a dependent must return early for reasons of national interest. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances.  The major commander, or his or her designated representative, may authorize PCS travel and transportation allowances to a designated place or, if the dependent is foreign-born, to a designated place in the dependent’s native country.  </p><p></p><p>a.  If the Service member receives a PCS order to a different PDS where dependent travel is authorized, the dependent travel and transportation allowance is from the designated location to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If national interests dictated that a dependent not be at the PDS, then a Service member is authorized PCS dependent travel and transportation allowances from the designated place or foreign location to the current PDS when the determining authority decides that the national interest no longer requires the dependent to stay away from the PDS.  </p><p></p><p>F.  Dependent Travel Due to Personal Situations, Including Disciplinary Action when a Service Member Is Stationed OCONUS .  The AO determines that the return is in the Government’s best interest and that the issue occurred after arrival at the PDS OCONUS.  The appropriate authority determines or agrees that local resources cannot resolve the problem.  A Service member who is permanently stationed OCONUS may request through the Secretarial Process travel and transportation allowances for a command-sponsored dependent to a designated place, even if the Service member’s PDS remains unchanged.  The designated place may be in the CONUS, non-foreign area OCONUS, or the spouses native country if he or she is foreign-born.  A command-sponsored dependent of a Service member serving a dependent-restricted tour OCONUS is eligible for travel and transportation allowances if the dependent remained at the Service member’s old PDS OCONUS after the Service member’s PCS, or the spouse is foreign-born and the dependent moved at Government expense to the spouse’s native country.  </p><p></p><p>1.  Table 5-21 specifies the authority for ERD travel.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-21.  Delegated Authority for ERD Travel Allowances</p><p>Dependent traveling…</p><p>Authority…</p><p>1</p><p>to a Location in the CONUS or Non-foreign Location OCONUS</p><p>An officer O-5 or higher, or equivalent-grade civilian employee, where the Service member is assigned and who is one of the following:</p><p>a.  At the activity-commander level.</p><p>b.  Support group’s commander.</p><p>c.  Unit’s commanding officer. </p><p>2</p><p>to a Foreign-born Dependent’s Native Country</p><p>The headquarters that directs the Service’s dependent transportation polices or procedures for travel to a foreign-born dependent’s native country.</p><p>3</p><p>when Disciplinary Actions Are Taken Against </p><p>Service Member</p><p>The officer exercising special or general court martial jurisdiction over the Service member. </p><p></p><p>2.  Table 5-22, specifies the only circumstances when dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized by this paragraph.  ERD must be authorized judiciously as the last resort.  If the Service member’s situation does not meet the criteria, the request must be denied.  A travel order and, when the approving official requests, supporting documentation is required.</p><p></p><p>a.  Except when death, serious illness, or incapacitation of a dependent or for compelling personal reasons, when a dependent travels without an order, no reimbursement for such travel is authorized even though an order is later issued. </p><p></p><p>b.  Recommendations from religious, mental health, financial management, family counseling, or legal agencies should be obtained, if appropriate, to demonstrate the need. </p><p></p><p>3.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized when disciplinary action,  in Table 5-22, is taken against a Service member stationed OCONUS whose dependent resides in the CONUS.  These allowances are limited to the cost from the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS, or the place the dependent was last transported at Government expense, as applicable, to the designated place or, if the dependent is foreign born, to the dependent’s native country.  A reasonable relationship must exist between the conditions and circumstances and the travel destination, which is determined through the Secretarial Process and may be authorized upon request of a dependent or former dependent, if the Service member is not available or has declined to make such a request. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-22.  Dependent Travel Due to Personal Situations, </p><p>Including Disciplinary Action when a Service Member is Stationed OCONUS</p><p>1</p><p>When Disciplinary Action is Taken </p><p>Against a Service Member Who Is</p><p>a.  sentenced by a court martial to be confined or to receive a punitive discharge (includes a bad conduct discharge, dishonorable discharge, and dismissal).</p><p>b.  sentenced to confinement in a foreign or U.S. civil confinement facility.</p><p>c.  discharged OCONUS under other than honorable conditions.</p><p>d.  returned to the CONUS for discharge under other than honorable conditions.</p><p>e.  returned to the CONUS to serve a sentence of confinement in a civil or military confinement facility.</p><p>f.  serving OCONUS and is dropped from the rolls, sent to prison under sentence, or transferred as a prisoner to a place of detention.</p><p>g.  serving OCONUS and is transferred to a different ship or location to await trial by court martial as a deserter or straggler.</p><p>h.  discharged under other than honorable conditions after surrendering to military authorities in the CONUS following a period of absence without leave from the PDS OCONUS,</p><p>i.  convicted by a court martial and placed on leave involuntarily while awaiting completion of an appellate review.  A statement of authorization or approval required under this situation must support the transportation procurement documents for allowances, which are limited to the cost to the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD.  </p><p>2</p><p>Other Circumstances Qualifying Dependent Travel Eligibility</p><p>a.  There is a death, serious illness, or incapacitation of a dependent ordinarily caring for a Service member’s minor dependent that requires, in the opinion of the authorizing or approving authority, that the minor dependent be transported to a place at which proper care may be maintained. </p><p>b.  There are compelling personal reasons, such as financial difficulties, marital difficulties, unforeseen family problems, death or serious illness of a close relative, or for reasons of a humanitarian or compassionate nature or other situations which have an adverse effect on the Service member’s performance of duty, and the best interests of a Service member, or the dependent, or the Government are served by the movement of one or more dependents.* </p><p>c.  Essential medical treatment is neither available at the Service member’s PDS nor readily available in the theater.** </p><p>d.  Educational facilities or housing for the dependent is inadequate.*** </p><p>e.  Conditions in a theater OCONUS are such that, although the evacuation of a dependent is neither warranted nor desired, the Service member is concerned justifiably for the dependent’s safety and wellbeing.**** </p><p>f.  A dependent receives an order from a Selective Service Board to report to the United States for induction into the U.S. Armed Forces. </p><p>g.  Acceptable employment opportunities for a dependent child age 18 years or older at the foreign PDS OCONUS are lacking.***** </p><p></p><p>         *The AO’s statement must support the circumstance and must not be used to authorize dependent student transportation to the CONUS to attend school.</p><p>       **The Service member’s request must be supported by medical documentation, including a statement by the attending physician, indicating that the treatment is essential to the dependent’s wellbeing.</p><p>     ***A statement from the AO is required that explains the inadequacy of such educational facilities or housing is due to conditions beyond the Service member’s control and that knowledge of those conditions arose after the dependent began to travel to the Service member’s PDS OCONUS.</p><p>  ****The Combatant Commander (CCDR) must make such determinations considering the recommendation of the major commander in the area for the Service concerned.  Determination authority may be delegated to no lower than a General Officer or flag officer in the respective CCDR’s headquarters.</p><p>*****The commanding officer of the activity concerned must determine that the lack of employment opportunity at the PDS and the resulting idleness may likely cause the dependent child to become involved in situations creating embarrassment to the United States that place additional administrative burdens on the commanding officer or have adverse effects on the Service member’s performance and that early return is in the best interest of the Service member, or dependent, and the United States.</p><p></p><p>G.  Escort for Dependent.  A Service member who is the sole parent (not another person), or a Service member married to another Service member (not both), may be authorized travel and transportation allowances to escort a dependent for an ERD.  Government transportation must be used on a space-required basis as the directed mode, when available.  If not available, then allowances are in Chapter 2 for TDY. </p><p></p><p>050805.  Dependent Travel Due to Divorce or Annulment </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member permanently stationed OCONUS whose marriage is terminated by divorce or annulment may be authorized travel and transportation allowances for a former family member.  The former family member must have been a formerly command-sponsored dependent residing with the Service member at the duty location OCONUS.  Movement of a former dependent must be in the best interest of the United States, the Service member, and the former dependent concerned.  </p><p></p><p>1.  The travel for the former family member must be authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member, who was the former sponsor, should request movement of the former family member.</p><p></p><p>3.  If the Service member is unavailable or declines to initiate a request for movement, the former spouse or former family member concerned may initiate the request.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The official must determine on a case-by-case basis that a reasonable relationship exists between the case’s conditions and circumstances, and the requested destination.  Travel must originate at or in the vicinity of the Service member’s present or former PDS OCONUS and must terminate in the United States, a non-foreign location OCONUS, or in the former dependent’s native country.  The allowances authorized are payable to the Service member, but may be paid directly to the former spouse when the Service member authorizes direct payment.</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation.  If transportation is not provided by Government or Government-procured means, reimbursement for personally procured commercial transportation and POV travel must follow standard PCS allowances, including applicable per diem.</p><p></p><p>2.  Time Limitation.  Travel must be completed within l year after the final divorce decree or annulment’s effective date or 6 months after the date the Service member completes personal PCS travel from the PDS OCONUS, whichever occurs first.  </p><p></p><p>a.  On a case-by-case basis, and only when the delay is not for personal preference, the commanding officer or designated representative at the duty location at or near the dependent or former dependent’s location may authorize or approve an extension of the 6-month time limit for up to 6 additional months.  Acceptable reasons for an extension include hospitalization, medical problems, and school year completion.</p><p></p><p>b.  If an extension to the 6-month time limit is authorized or approved, travel must be completed within 1 year of the final divorce decree or annulment’s effective date or the date the Service member completes personal travel from the PDS OCONUS for a PCS, whichever occurs first.</p><p></p><p>3.  Dependent Returns</p><p></p><p>a.  If a custody agreement changes, or the Service member makes other legal arrangements, and a former family member becomes a dependent of the Service member again, the dependent’s return to the Service member’s PDS OCONUS may be authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member cannot have received a PCS order, must be otherwise authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances, and must have at least 12 months remaining on the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the dependent’s scheduled arrival date.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The dependent must be command-sponsored before travel and his or her return must be for the Government’s convenience.  Travel and transportation allowances are limited to direct travel from the place to which the former family member was transported at Government expense to the PDS OCONUS along a usually traveled route.</p><p></p><p>b.  If the Service member remarries and a former family member becomes a dependent of the Service member again, the dependent is not authorized to return to the Service member’s PDS OCONUS at Government expense.  If the Service member returns the former dependent to the PDS OCONUS at personal expense and the former dependent is again command-sponsored, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the PDS on a subsequent PCS.</p><p></p><p>050806.  Ordered to a PDS OCONUS and Dependents Authorized to Travel </p><p></p><p>When a Service member is ordered on a PCS to a PDS OCONUS and dependent travel is authorized, the Service member is authorized the dependent travel and transportation allowances if the dependent actually travels.</p><p></p><p>A.  Dependent Authorized Concurrent Travel with Service Member.  When a dependent is authorized concurrent travel to the PDS OCONUS, the Service member is authorized dependent travel allowances from the dependent’s location when the Service member receives the PCS order to the PDS OCONUS.  Allowances are limited to direct travel from the last place where the dependent was transported at Government expense to the new PDS along a usually traveled route.  Government transportation facilities for transoceanic travel should be used when available.</p><p></p><p>B.  Concurrent Dependent Travel Denied with Anticipated Delay of 20 or More Weeks from the Service Member’s Port Reporting Month</p><p></p><p>1.  When concurrent dependent travel is denied by a proper authority for 20 or more weeks from the Service member’s port reporting month, the Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances to a designated place in the CONUS or to a designated place in a non-foreign area OCONUS if: </p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member was a legal resident of that state, commonwealth, territory, or possession, before entering on active duty.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member’s spouse was a legal resident of that location at the time of marriage. </p><p></p><p>c.  The Service member was called to active duty from that location or it is the Service member’s HOR.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the designated place to the PDS OCONUS if authorized at a later date, provided the dependent is command-sponsored before travel and the Service member has at least 12 months remaining on the tour OCONUS on the date the dependent is scheduled to arrive.</p><p></p><p>C.  Concurrent Dependent Travel Denied with Anticipated Delay of Less than 20 Weeks from Member’s Port Reporting Month.  When the anticipated dependent travel delay is less than 20 weeks from the Service member’s port reporting month, the dependent’s total travel and transportation allowances are limited to the allowances from the last place to which transported at Government expense to the new PDS.  Reimbursement for the authorized travel is made after travel to the PDS OCONUS is completed.</p><p></p><p>D.  Service Member Chooses to Serve an Unaccompanied Tour.  A Service member who chooses to serve an unaccompanied tour may leave the dependent at the current location or move him or her to either a designated place in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.  If the move is to a non-foreign area OCONUS, one of the following is required:</p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member was a legal resident of that area before entering active duty.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member’s spouse was a legal resident of that area at the time of marriage.</p><p></p><p>3.  The Service member was called to active duty from that area.</p><p></p><p>4.  The area is the Service member’s HOR.</p><p></p><p>5.  Authorization or approval through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>E.  Sufficient Time in Service Remains.  If the Service member is scheduled to serve an accompanied tour immediately after completing an unaccompanied tour, that location OCONUS may be authorized as a designated place.  The Service member must have sufficient time in service remaining to complete the unaccompanied tour and the subsequent accompanied tour.  A dependent cannot be moved again at Government expense until a subsequent PCS order is issued or the Service member is selected to serve an IPCOT.  A Service member moving a dependent to a designated place may move the dependent to the PDS OCONUS at personal expense.  If the dependent is command-sponsored at the PDS OCONUS after arrival, he or she may be moved from that PDS at Government expense when a subsequent PCS order is issued.</p><p></p><p>F.  Reimbursement for Transoceanic Travel.  Section 0502 also applies to reimbursement for authorized transoceanic travel performed by a dependent at personal expense.</p><p></p><p>050807.  Reassigned OCONUS Due To Base Closure or Similar Action before the Ordered Tour OCONUS Is Completed  </p><p></p><p>A Service member, accompanied by a command-sponsored dependent, who is involuntarily transferred on a PCS order due to base closure or similar action between PDSs OCONUS, is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances to the new PDS if dependents are authorized at the new PDS.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized to a designated place if the Service member is ordered on an unaccompanied tour at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>A.  Subsequent PCS.  Upon a subsequent PCS transfer from the new PDS, dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized, regardless of the length of time served at the Service member’s last PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Tour-Length Restrictions.  If the move is within the same theater, tour-length restrictions do not apply.</p><p></p><p>050808.  Dependent Travel and Transportation Due to an Alert Notice </p><p></p><p>A Service member of a unit is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances as though assigned to a dependent-restricted tour when the unit is officially alerted for movement to a PDS OCONUS to which dependent travel and transportation is not authorized (45 Comp. Gen. 208 (1965)).  This applies when the anticipated move is within 90 days after the alert notice.  This also applies to a Service member on a PCS order to the unit after the unit has received the alert notice.</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member Relocates.  When a Service member is ordered to a PDS where dependent travel is authorized instead of to the dependent-restricted PDS OCONUS contained in the alert notice, then dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the designated place to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Service Member Does not Relocate.  If the Service member stays at the alerted PDS, then dependents are authorized return travel to that PDS.</p><p></p><p>050809.  Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) </p><p></p><p>A Service member stationed OCONUS who is selected to serve a consecutive overseas tour (COT) is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-23.

A Service member may leave a command-sponsored dependent at the old PDS when this location is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  Delegation may not be below the Service headquarters that directs the dependent transportation policies or procedures.  This location is then a designated place and the Service member may receive station allowances at the with-dependent rate.  A dependent is no longer command-sponsored once the Service member departs on a PCS order.</p><p>4</p><p>Accompanied </p><p>to Accompanied</p><p>A dependent may be moved to the new PDS, if he or she was command-sponsored before travel, when a Service member serves an accompanied tour at the new PDS.  A Service member assigned to a key billet and choosing to serve without dependents is authorized allowances for dependent travel and transportation to a designated place.</p><p></p><p>050810.  Dependent Travel and Transportation for an In-Place COT (IPCOT) </p><p></p><p>This paragraph covers authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances for a Service member stationed OCONUS who is selected to serve an IPCOT.

A Service member who gains a dependent after the PCS order’s effective date, but before he or she begins an IPCOT, is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances to the current PDS where the IPCOT will be served if the dependent is command sponsored before travel to the current PDS.  Travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the place where the dependent is located to the current PDS.</p><p>2</p><p>Accompanied</p><p>to Unaccompanied</p><p>A dependent may remain at the current location or may be authorized to move to either a designated place in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.  If the move is to a non-foreign area OCONUS, one of the following is required:</p><p>a.  The Service member was a legal resident of that area before entering active duty.</p><p>b.  The Service member’s spouse was a legal resident of that area at the time of marriage.</p><p>c.  The Service member was called to active duty from that area.</p><p>d.

Consecutive Tours OCONUS for A Service Member with A Non-Command-Sponsored Dependent </p><p></p><p>A Service member ordered on a PCS between PDSs OCONUS, who has a non-command-sponsored dependent at or near the old PDS, is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances if the Service member is to serve an accompanied tour at the new PDS OCONUS.  A Service member who was authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances when he or she was assigned to the old PDS OCONUS is authorized actual dependent travel performed, limited to the allowances from where the dependent was last moved at Government expense.  A Service member who was not authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances when he or she was assigned to the old PDS OCONUS is limited to the travel and transportation allowances from the point of embarkation in the CONUS serving the old PDS to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>050812.  Consecutive Overseas Tour Leave </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  When a Service member is selected to serve a COT or an IPCOT, the Service member and his or her dependent may be eligible for COT leave.  The Service member and the dependent must meet eligibility requirements to qualify for COT leave, and once qualified, may travel together, or may travel independently on separate trips.  Table 5-25 specifies the eligibility requirements.  DoDI 1315.18 (Military Personnel Assignments) contains requirements for COT leave, including the specific requirements for a COT when the Service member is assigned to Alaska or Hawaii. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-25.  Eligibility for COT Leave</p><p>1</p><p>Service Member</p><p>A Service member must be stationed OCONUS and ordered to one of the following:</p><p>a.  An IPCOT.</p><p>b.  A COT for the designated tour at the new PDS and one of the following applies:</p><p>c.  One tour is unaccompanied.</p><p>d.  Both tours are accompanied and the total time to be served at the PDSs is equal to or greater than the sum of the unaccompanied tour lengths for the PDSs.</p><p>2</p><p>Service Member’s Dependent*</p><p>A dependent must meet all of the following criteria:</p><p>a.  Be a dependent on the last day of the Service member’s first tour at the old PDS OCONUS or is a dependent on the effective date of the PCS order to the new PDS OCONUS.</p><p>b.  Be command-sponsored for both tours.</p><p>c.  Be located at or in the vicinity of the Service member’s old PDS OCONUS.  If the dependent has been evacuated from the PDS, then the dependent must have been evacuated from the vicinity of the old PDS OCONUS.  </p><p>d.  Accompany the Service member during both tours.</p><p>*COT leave travel and transportation allowances are authorized for a command-sponsored dependent born during a COT leave deferral period. </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is in a travel status during direct travel between authorized locations.  For other travel for personal convenience, other types of leave, and administrative absence, a Service member’s travel status is limited to the constructed travel time that is equal to the time required for direct travel between authorized locations by available transportation.  See par. 050205 and DoDI 1327.06 (Leave and Liberty). </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  An eligible Service member for his or her travel, and on behalf of an eligible dependent, is authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances between authorized locations.  Transportation and other reimbursable expenses between the Service member’s PDS and the authorized air terminal may be reimbursed as local transportation in Chapter 2.  See PDT computation example 6.</p><p></p><p>1.  City Pair Program airfares are authorized for use between the authorized locations.</p><p></p><p>2.  Travel between authorized locations is from: </p><p></p><p>a.  the old PDS OCONUS to an authorized destination and return to the old PDS OCONUS, if the Service member is serving an IPCOT.</p><p></p><p>b.  the old PDS OCONUS to an authorized destination, and then to the new PDS OCONUS.</p><p>c.  the old PDS OCONUS to an authorized destination and returning to the old PDS OCONUS before going to the new PDS OCONUS only when the Service member or dependent drives a POV to the new PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>d.  the new PDS OCONUS to an authorized destination and return to the new PDS OCONUS when COT leave is deferred.</p><p></p><p>e.  the old PDS to a designated place where a dependent is or was located if authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p>f.  the place where a Service member or dependent is located, if either is temporarily absent from the PDS and begins COT leave from the place away from the PDS, to the authorized destination, and return to the appropriate location (either the old PDS or the new PDS).  Travel and transportation is limited to the cost from the old PDS OCONUS to the authorized destination, and then to the new PDS OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>3.  If the Service authorizes or approves the Service member to use a POV for COT leave transportation, a monetary allowance in lieu of transportation (MALT) plus flat per diem (MALT Plus) for a PCS is authorized.  If the Service does not authorize the use of a POV for COT leave transportation, and the Service member or dependent uses a POV anyway, then the reimbursement is limited to the policy-constructed airfare.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Authorized Destination.  The authorized destination is the Service member’s HOR.  Transportation to any other location is limited to the cost had the Service member or dependent traveled to the HOR.  </p><p></p><p>1.  If transportation to a selected alternate location is more expensive than transportation to the HOR, the Service member is financially responsible for the additional cost unless transportation to the more expensive alternate location is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p></p><p>2.  If the Service member or dependent travels to a more expensive alternate location, and that location has not been authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process, then City Pair Program airfares cannot be used for transportation to or from the more expensive alternate location. </p><p></p><p>D.  Scheduling COT Leave Travel</p><p></p><p>1.  Schedule to take COT leave between the tours OCONUS and in connection with PCS travel, if any. </p><p></p><p>2.  When the Service member’s HOR is in the CONUS, COT leave travel may be deferred until after PCS travel is completed only if the deferred travel is authorized or approved in Service regulations. </p><p></p><p>3.  When the Service member’s HOR is OCONUS, he or she may elect to defer COT leave travel until after the PCS is completed. </p><p></p><p>4.  When COT leave travel is allowed to be deferred it must be completed before the tour at the new PDS ends, unless the reason travel is deferred is due to duty in a contingency operation.  If a dependent takes deferred COT leave, that dependent must have been located in the vicinity of the Service member’s old PDS OCONUS while the Service member was at that old PDS.  If the COT leave is not taken before the end of the tour, the authority for COT leave expires. </p><p></p><p>5.  When COT leave is deferred due to duty in a contingency operation, the COT leave must occur within 1 year after the contingency operation duty ends.</p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member is authorized COT leave from the new PDS OCONUS to an authorized location.  The cost from the new PDS and return is limited to what it would have cost to travel to the HOR from the PDS from which deferred travel could not be taken and return. </p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member cannot combine COT leave with any other leave or travel allowance while on the contingency operation unless the combination is in accordance with Service regulations or unless the Service member specifically requests, and is authorized by the Secretary concerned, to take the deferred COT leave with another leave or travel allowance. </p><p></p><p>E.  Limitations</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member on a 12-month unaccompanied tour to a FEML location who extends for a consecutive second 12-month tour is eligible for only one funded-leave transportation program.  The Service member may take COT leave or FEML, but not both.  </p><p></p><p>2.  COT leave must not be used as dependent student travel.  That means the student cannot travel from the CONUS to the PDS OCONUS and then return to the CONUS using COT leave allowances. </p><p></p><p>3.  The Service member or dependent cannot use a cruise or tour package for COT leave. </p><p></p><p>4.  COT leave travel and transportation is not authorized if a Service member chooses 15 days of leave and transportation under the SR&amp;R leave program, or either cash or 30 days of leave without funded transportation under the SR&amp;R leave program.  </p><p></p><p>050813.  Dependent Travel and Transportation Due to a Service Member’s Tour Extension </p><p></p><p>A Service member who is on a tour that is less than the specified tour length at a PDS, and whose tour length is extended due to unusual circumstances and the needs of the Service, may be eligible for dependent travel and transportation allowances.  The Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances only when he or she did not move a dependent to that PDS initially due to the anticipated short time on that assignment.  The allowance is from the place where the dependent is located to the current PDS, limited to the cost from the old PDS to the current PDS.</p><p></p><p>050814.  Dependent-Restricted Tour </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member may receive dependent travel and transportation allowances when he or she is reassigned by a PCS order on a dependent-restricted tour.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member may leave the dependent at the current location or move the dependent from the old PDS, HOR, or PLEAD if it is the Service member’s first PCS on active duty, to a designated place in:</p><p></p><p>1.  The CONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A non-foreign area OCONUS.  For a move to a non-foreign area OCONUS, one of the following is required:</p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member was a legal resident of that area before entering on active duty.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member’s spouse was a legal resident of that area at the time of marriage.</p><p></p><p>c.  The Service member was called to active duty from that area.</p><p></p><p>d.  It is the Service member’s HOR.</p><p>e.  Authorization or approval through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>3.  A location OCONUS at which the PCS order states the Service member is to serve an accompanied tour immediately after completing the dependent-restricted tour, or a tour under unusually arduous sea duty in par. 050907.  The Service member must have sufficient time in service remaining to complete the dependent-restricted tour and the subsequent tour.</p><p></p><p>4.  A location OCONUS that has been justified under unusual conditions or circumstances and authorized or approved by the Secretary concerned.  This authority may not be delegated below the Service headquarters that directs dependent travel and transportation policy and procedures.</p><p></p><p>a.  For an Armed Forces’ member, the Secretary concerned may only authorize a location OCONUS to return a foreign-born dependent to the spouse’s native country in accordance with DoDI 1315.18 (Military Personnel Assignments).</p><p></p><p>b.  The Commandant of the Coast Guard (CG-13) may make an exception for a Coast Guard member.</p><p></p><p>c.  A dependent residing in the same country as the Service member cannot be command-sponsored if moved there under this authority.</p><p></p><p>C.  Subsequent Authority.  If the dependent is temporarily absent from the old PDS, designated place, or safe haven when a PCS order is received, see par. 050407 and par. 050408.</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member is ordered from a dependent-restricted tour to a location where dependent travel is authorized.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized to the new PDS from whichever of the following locations results in the lowest reimbursement:</p><p></p><p>a.  The dependent’s location when the Service member receives the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>b.  The place the dependent was last moved at Government expense.  </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is on a dependent-restricted tour when the restriction against dependent travel to the Service member’s PDS is lifted.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized to the Service member’s current PDS from whichever of the following locations results in the lowest reimbursement:</p><p></p><p>a.  The dependent’s location on the date the restriction against dependent travel was changed.</p><p></p><p>b.  The place the dependent was last moved at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>050815.  PDS Changed to a Dependent-Restricted Tour Location </p><p></p><p>When a Service member receives a PCS order to a PDS where dependent travel is authorized and that PDS is later changed to a dependent-restricted PDS, then this subparagraph provides authority for dependent travel and transportation allowances to a designated place in accordance with par. 050814.  See Chapter 6 for travel and transportation allowances involving an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>A.  Change after an Order Is Received.  When a change is implemented after the date the Service member first receives his or her PCS order but before the dependent begins travel from the Service member’s old PDS, the authority for dependent travel and transportation allowances is determined in accordance with par. 050814-B.</p><p></p><p>B.  Change after a Dependent Begins Travel.  When a change is implemented after a dependent begins travel, indirectly or otherwise, on or after the date the Service member first receives the PCS order, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the old PDS to the place where the dependent received notification of the change and from that place to a designated place authorized in par. 050814.  Travel and transportation allowances are limited to those from the old PDS to the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  The port of embarkation serving the Service member’s PDS OCONUS and from the port of embarkation to a place authorized in par. 050814.</p><p></p><p>2.  The home port of the ship and from the home port to a place authorized in par. 050814 in the case of a change in designation of the duty of a ship.</p><p></p><p>C.  Change while the Dependent Is at a Designated Place.  If the dependent is at a designated place authorized in par. 050814 where he or she was located under a prior order on the date he or she first received notification of the change, no dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized.</p><p></p><p>D.  Change after a Dependent Leaves the Designated Place.  When the change is implemented after the dependent begins travel from an authorized designated place  on or after the date the Service member first receives the PCS order, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized.  Allowances are from that designated place to the location he or she first receives notification of the change and from that location to the previous or a new designated place.  The authority is limited to that location from the designated place where travel began to the CONUS home port or the port of embarkation serving the Service member’s PDS OCONUS and from that home port or that port of embarkation to the designated place last chosen.  </p><p></p><p>E.  Change while En Route from the Old PDS.  When the change is implemented after the dependent begins travel and before the dependent arrives at or in the vicinity of the Service member’s PDS OCONUS, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized.  Allowances are from the old PDS where travel begins, to the place where the dependent first receives notification of the change and from that location to a: </p><p></p><p>1.  Designated place in the CONUS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Temporary location OCONUS authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>3.  Designated place in a non-foreign area OCONUS if authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>F.  Change after the Dependent Arrives at the Service Member’s Duty Location.  When the change is implemented after the dependent arrives at the Service member’s PDS or home port OCONUS, or is not known to the dependent until arrival at or in the vicinity of that PDS, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized to the same locations and under the same conditions as when a change is implemented while en route from the old PDS.  </p><p></p><p>G.  Subsequent Authority.  A Service member authorized dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances is authorized dependent travel to the PDS, limited to the cost of travel from the place where the dependent was last transported at Government expense to the Service member’s PDS, if any of the following circumstances apply:</p><p></p><p>1.  The duty location changes from a dependent-restricted location or unusually arduous sea duty to one where dependent transportation is authorized.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member is assigned to a location where dependent transportation is authorized.</p><p></p><p>H.  Dependent Stays at a Place Where He or She Traveled.</p><p></p><p>1.  When the dependent is in the CONUS, return transportation to the same or another PDS OCONUS may only be authorized when at least 12 months remain in the Service member’s tour OCONUS following the later of either the dependent’s estimated date of arrival at the PDS or the date command sponsorship is granted.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the Service member chooses, the dependent may stay at the place where he or she traveled in accordance with this paragraph until further transportation is authorized.  A dependent may stay at a temporary location OCONUS to which transported when the change is implemented while en route from the old PDS or home port (see par. 050815-E) only when authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>050816.

Reimbursement is authorized for transportation when Government or Government-procured transportation is not available, limited to the policy-constructed airfare over the direct route between the origin and destination.</p><p></p><p>7.  Other Travel.  For travel to and from carrier terminals, reimbursement is authorized in accordance with Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>a.  Overland travel should be by Government-procured transportation or at personal expense on a reimbursable basis if a TMC is not available.</p><p></p><p>b.  When a POV is used, the TDY mileage rate is authorized, limited to the cost had a TMC provided Government-procured transportation.</p><p></p><p>c.  Government-procured air transportation usually is furnished for the portion of the travel within the United States.</p><p></p><p>8.  Unaccompanied Baggage.  Unaccompanied baggage of up to 350 pounds may be transported for each authorized trip between the school and the Service member’s PDS.  The Service member is financially responsible for any overweight unaccompanied baggage during educational travel.</p><p></p><p>9.  Baggage Storage.  During a student’s annual trip between the school and the Service member’s PDS, or during a different period in the same fiscal year selected by the Service member, a Service member may store the student’s unaccompanied baggage, limited to 350 pounds, in the school vicinity in lieu of transporting the unaccompanied baggage.  The Service concerned may pay, or a Service member may be reimbursed for, the storage cost, limited to the cost of round-trip transportation for unaccompanied baggage.</p><p></p><p>0509  PCS IN CONNECTION WITH SHIPS AND SEA DUTY HOME PORT</p><p></p><p>When the new PDS is a ship, the locality per diem rate is based on the location where the ship is boarded.  If the ship is at sea, then the locality per diem rate is based on the last location that the ship departed.  See See PDT computation example 4.</p><p></p><p>050901.  Ship, Mobile Unit, or Organization Undergoing a Home Port Change </p><p></p><p>A Service member assigned to a unit undergoing a home port change may be eligible for PCS allowances in Table 5-27.  Travel must begin within 1 year from the effective date of the home port change, unless the time limit is specified otherwise in Table 5-26 or extended through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-27.  PCS Allowances for a Service Member Undergoing a Home Port Change</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a Service member is unable to travel to the new home port or PDS with his or her organization for reasons acceptable to the Service, </p><p>the Service member is authorized PCS allowances to later join the organization under a proper order. </p><p>2</p><p>a unit’s home port is changed and the mobile unit or ship is at the old home port,</p><p>a Service member may be authorized PCS allowances from the old home port to the new home port and return to the unit by way of any TDY location. </p><p>3</p><p>a unit’s home port changed,</p><p>a Service member may be authorized PCS allowances to the old home port and then to the new home port by way of any TDY locations. </p><p>4</p><p>a Service member is on leave from a deployed unit whose home port is changed,</p><p>PCS allowances begin from the leave point to the old home port and continue to the new home port.  This is limited to the allowances authorized had the Service member started from the unit’s location when he or she departed on leave rather than from the leave point. </p><p>5</p><p>a unit is ordered to a new home port or PDS and a Service member assigned to it is unable, due to mission requirements, to assist with the move of HHG or a POV, or to accompany dependents, to the new location before the effective change date,</p><p>he or she may return from the new home port to the old home port after the effective change date to move HHG or a POV, or to accompany dependents, to the new home port.  </p><p>a.  Travel must begin within 180 days after the effective date of the home port change and before the order expiration date.</p><p>b.  Requests for travel commencing after 180 days must be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p>c.  This does not apply in the case of a home port change announcement or when a unit’s home port is officially changed.</p><p>6</p><p>a Service member assigned to a mobile unit or ship is undergoing a home port change,</p><p>he or she may travel to a place other than the old or new home port, limited to the PCS allowances otherwise specified in this table and Table 5-28. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>050902.  Service Member Ordered on a PCS to or from a Ship or Mobile Unit Operating away from Its Home Port </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member on PCS orders to or from a ship or mobile unit operating away from its home port or PDS may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Allowances for an eligible Service member are in Table 5-28.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-28.  PCS Allowances for a Service Member Ordered to or from a Ship or Mobile Unit Operating away from Home Port</p><p>If a Service member </p><p>is ordered on a PCS…</p><p>Then the Service member </p><p>may be paid PCS allowances…</p><p>1</p><p>from a unit that is away from its home port or PDS,</p><p>from the location where PCS travel begins to the new PDS via the old home port or PDS and any TDY locations. </p><p>2</p><p>from a unit undergoing a home port change and detaches after the home port change effective date,</p><p>from the unit to the new PDS via the old home port or a designated place, if applicable, and any TDY locations. </p><p>3</p><p>to a unit that is away from its home port or PDS,</p><p>from the old PDS to the new unit via its home port, PDS, and any TDY locations. </p><p>4</p><p>to a unit whose home port change has been announced and he or she travels to the new home port before or after the effective date of the home port change,</p><p>from the old PDS to the unit via the new home port and any TDY locations. </p><p>5</p><p>to a newly commissioned ship and the ship’s announced home port is different from the Service member’s old PDS,</p><p>to the old PDS or home port, then to the ship’s announced home port via any TDY locations, and then to the place at which the ship is located.  For two-crew ships, both crews may be paid these allowances.  Travel must begin within 1 year from the ship’s commissioning effective date. </p><p></p><p>050903.  Dependent Travel when a Service Member Assigned to a Ship or Mobile Unit is Undergoing a Home Port Change or Unit Move</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member’s dependent may be eligible for travel and transportation allowances when the Service member is assigned to a ship or mobile unit and undergoing a change in home port or unit move.  A “home port change announcement” is an order modification until the PCS order is amended, modified, canceled, or revoked.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Allowances for an eligible dependent are payable as specified in Table 5-29.</p><p></p><p>Note:  When determining dependent travel and transportation allowances, a mobile unit or ship-based staff with an assigned home port (as opposed to an assigned PDS) has the same status as a ship with an assigned home port. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-29.  Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances during a Home Port Change</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a Service member’s unit is specified as unusually arduous sea duty and the home port change is due to completion of an overhaul,</p><p>on the effective date of the home port change, dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the old home port or designated place to the new home port or designated place. </p><p>2</p><p>a Service member’s home port change involves unusually arduous sea duty and the dependent travels from the old home port or a designated place to somewhere other than the new home port,</p><p>the dependent’s travel is limited to allowances from the old home port or designated place to the new home port. </p><p>3</p><p>a Service member is on duty with a ship, afloat staff, or an afloat unit on the home port change effective date, that home port change is a PCS for dependent travel and transportation purposes,</p><p>the dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the old home port to the new home port.</p><p>4</p><p>an official announcement has been made designating a home port change,</p><p>travel and transportation allowances for a dependent may no longer be paid to the old home port in connection with a PCS order to the unit at that old home port.  This may include a Service member who delayed dependent travel or transportation to the old home port or is issued a PCS order to the unit naming the old home port after the home port change was announced.  It does not affect allowances for a dependent transported after a PCS order is received and who is in a transit or in an otherwise irreversible transportation status on the date of the announcement.</p><p>5</p><p>a Service member delays travel due to mission requirements and is unable to assist with moving his or her HHG or a POV, or cannot accompany dependents to the new home port,</p><p>only the Service member, not the dependents, is allowed to travel from the new home port back to the old home port after the effective change date of the home port change. </p><p></p><p>E.  Home Port Change</p><p></p><p>1.  Unusually Arduous Sea Duty.  When on duty with a unit specified as unusually arduous sea duty on the home port change effective date, a Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from the old home port or designated place to the new home port if the home port change is due to commencement of an overhaul to be performed at the new home port.  If travel is from:</p><p></p><p>a.  The old home port to a location other than the new home port, par. 050408 applies.</p><p></p><p>b.  A designated place to a location other than the new home port, the dependent travel and transportation allowances are limited to travel directly from the designated place to the new home port by a usually traveled route.</p><p></p><p>2.  Completion of an Overhaul.  When on duty with a unit undergoing a home port change due to a ship overhaul, a Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances from:</p><p></p><p>a.  The old home port to the new home port or to a designated place if the home port change is due to completion of an overhaul.  If travel is from:</p><p></p><p>(1)  A location other than the old home port to the new home port, par. 050408 applies.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A location other than the old home port to a designated place, the authority is limited to that from the old home port to a designated place.</p><p></p><p>b.  The old home port or from a designated place to the new home port or from the old home port to a designated place, if the home port change is not due to an overhaul.  Travel from one designated place to another is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>F.  Home Port Change Announcement.  When an official announcement has been made designating a home port change, travel and transportation allowances for a dependent may no longer be paid to the old home port for a PCS order to the unit at that old home port.  The home port change announcement is an order modification until such time as the PCS order is later amended, modified, canceled, or revoked.</p><p></p><p>1.  A dependent transported after a PCS order is received and who is in transit or in an otherwise irreversible transportation status on the date the announcement was made can receive PCS allowances to continue on to the old home port. </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member who has delayed dependent travel or transportation to the old home port, or been issued a PCS order to the unit naming the old home port after the home port change has been announced cannot receive dependent allowances to the old home port.</p><p></p><p>050904.  Dependent Travel when a Service Member Transfers to, from, or Between Sea Duty Assignments Not Specified As Unusually Arduous Sea Duty </p><p></p><p>A.  Travel and Transportation Authorized.  When a Service member is transferred between PDSs, neither of which is unusually arduous sea duty, dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the old PDS to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Travel and Transportation not Authorized.  Except for assignments involving duty  on a dependent-restricted tour or unusually arduous sea duty, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are not authorized when the old and new PDS are the same (B-185099, June 1, 1976).</p><p></p><p>050905.  Ship Being Constructed or Undergoing Overhaul or Inactivation </p><p></p><p>A.  Dependent Allowances.  A dependent may be provided transportation, specified in this paragraph, but no per diem or reimbursement for meals and lodging, to the overhaul or inactivation port when the dependent resides in the area of the home port or former home port.  The term “area” means places surrounding the home port from which personnel customarily commute daily to the home port.  The dependent’s travel is limited to what it would cost for a Service member to travel round trip on Government-procured, commercial transportation.  This dependent travel would replace the Service member’s travel.  One of the following circumstances must be met:</p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member is on duty aboard a ship being overhauled or inactivated at a place other than its home port.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member is on duty aboard a ship being overhauled or inactivated if the home port is changed to the port of overhaul or inactivation.</p><p>B.  Timing.  A dependent must not be provided transportation under this paragraph unless the Service member has been assigned to the ship for more than 30 consecutive days.  All travel authorized under this paragraph must begin before the ship departs from the overhaul or inactivation port.  Dependent travel, instead of the Service member’s travel, may be provided on or after the 31st day after the date the ship enters the overhaul or inactivation port or after the date the Service member becomes permanently assigned to the ship, whichever occurs later.  An additional trip may be provided every 60th day thereafter.  A dependent who is authorized a round trip before using a prior authorization does not lose a previously earned authorization.</p><p></p><p>C.  Ship’s Home Port Changed.  When the ship undergoes a home port change to the overhaul or inactivation port, the dependent is authorized travel between the ship’s former home port and the overhaul or inactivation port instead of PCS allowances if, due to personal situations, the dependent is not relocated to the overhaul or  inactivation port, such as a dependent receiving medical care and no similar facility exists at the overhaul or inactivation port.</p><p></p><p>D.  Ship’s Home Port not Changed.  When the ship’s home port is not changed, dependent travel is authorized between the home port and the overhaul or inactivation port unless the Service member has elected personal travel under par. 031102, in which case dependent travel in this paragraph is not authorized.  The Service member has the option to alternate travel, such as Service member, dependent, Service member, each time the authority becomes available.  Dependent travel in this paragraph is limited to the cost of Government-procured, round-trip travel for the Service member.</p><p></p><p>E.  Dependent Travel while the Ship Is Being Constructed</p><p></p><p>1.  The dependent of a Service member may be provided or reimbursed for round-trip transportation when all of the following apply to the Service member:</p><p></p><p>a.  He or she is assigned to permanent duty in conjunction with the construction of a ship.</p><p></p><p>b.  His or her duty location is not the ship’s designated future home port or area where the dependent resides.</p><p></p><p>2.  Travel can be to the construction port from either the site of the ship’s future home port or the area where the dependent resides.  If the Service member has elected personal travel under par. 031102, dependent transportation in this paragraph is not authorized.  A Service member has the option to personally travel or substitute dependent travel each time the authority becomes available.  </p><p></p><p>3.  Authorization for transportation accrues on or after the 31st consecutive day after the date the Service member is permanently assigned to the ship.  An additional trip may be provided every 60th day thereafter.  A dependent who receives authorization for a round trip before using a prior authorization does not lose a previously earned authorized round trip.  All travel in this paragraph must begin before the ship departs the construction port.</p><p></p><p>F.  Transportation Allowances.  The standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 apply.  The transportation is limited to the cost of Government-procured, commercial round-trip air transportation between the Service member’s home port or former home port and the ship’s overhaul or inactivation port.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>050906.  Sea Duty Changed to Unusually Arduous Sea Duty </p><p></p><p>When there is a change in the designation of the duty aboard a ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit from sea duty to unusually arduous sea duty, then follow the provisions in par. 050815 for dependent travel and transportation allowances to a designated place.</p><p></p><p>050907.  Unusually Arduous Sea Duty or Sea Duty Specified OCONUS of 1 Year or More </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member  may be eligible for dependent travel and transportation allowances when he or she is: </p><p></p><p>1.  Assigned by a PCS order to a ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit specified in writing through the Secretarial Process as involving unusually arduous sea duty. </p><p></p><p>2.  Permanently assigned to a ship or afloat staff on the date it is specified through the Secretarial Process as in an area OCONUS for an expected continuous period of 1 year or more. </p><p></p><p>3.  Assigned by a PCS order to a ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit after the date it is specified through the Secretarial Process as in an area OCONUS for an expected continuous period of 1 year or more.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized from the old PDS to the new PDS.  If the new PDS is a dependent-restricted tour, or to a ship or afloat staff specified as in an area OCONUS for an expected continuous period of 1 year or more, then the allowances are authorized to a designated place in par. 050814-B.</p><p></p><p>C.  Subsequent Authority.  If the dependent is temporarily absent from the old PDS, designated place, or safe haven when a PCS order is received, see par. 050407 and par. 050408.</p><p></p><p>1.  If the Service member is reassigned from a specified ship, afloat staff, or an afloat unit, then allowances are authorized from the dependent’s location on receipt of the PCS order or from the place the dependent was last moved at Government expense (whichever results in the least reimbursement) to the PDS.  This does not apply when the Service member is serving a dependent-restricted tour at the new PDS or another specified ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the Service member is on permanent duty aboard a ship or on an afloat staff when the ship or staff is relieved from unusually arduous sea duty or relieved from the specified continuous overseas duty of 1 year or more, then the allowances to the PDS are from whichever of the following locations results in the lowest reimbursement:</p><p></p><p>a.  The dependent’s location on the date the ship or afloat staff changes status.</p><p></p><p>b.  The place the dependent was last moved at Government expense.  </p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member is authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances, including when the home port of the old ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit and the new PDS are identical (57 Comp. Gen. 266 (1978)).</p><p></p><p></p><p>0510  RETIREMENT AND SEPARATION</p><p></p><p>051001.  Eligible Retirees and Separated Service Members</p><p></p><p>A Service member must actually travel to the appropriate location to be eligible for travel and transportation allowances in this section when any of the following occur: </p><p></p><p>A.  Discharge, resignation, or separation under honorable conditions.</p><p></p><p>B.  Release of an RC member from active duty, including active duty for training, if the Service member has served 20 or more weeks at one location.</p><p></p><p>C.  Transfer to the Fleet Reserve or to the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.</p><p></p><p>D.  Retirement.</p><p></p><p>E.  Temporary disability retirement.</p><p></p><p>F.  Discharge or separation from military duty under conditions other than honorable.</p><p></p><p>051002.  Service Member Separates or is Released from Active Duty, Excluding a Discharge with Severance or Separation Pay</p><p></p><p>A Service member on active duty who separates or is released from the Service, unless otherwise specified in this section, may be eligible for PCS travel and transportation allowances for his or herself and for a dependent.  The Service member must have a break in service of at least 1 day and actually travel.  A Service member is authorized travel from the last PDS to his or her HOR or PLEAD.  A dependent is authorized travel from the PDS or place where he or she was last transported at Government expense to the HOR or PLEAD, whichever the Service member selects.  A different location may be selected or travel may be between other locations.  However, reimbursement is limited to the amount that would have been paid if the Service member had traveled from the last PDS to the HOR or PLEAD.  See Chapter 5, Part C for HHG transportation. </p><p></p><p>A.  Officer HOR Correction.  An officer whose HOR was incorrectly indicated as the place where he or she was serving instead of the actual HOR is authorized dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances to the correct HOR when relieved from active duty if the Service member meets the following criteria: </p><p></p><p>1.  The HOR was incorrectly listed when he or she was commissioned from an enlisted grade, commissioned in the regular Service while serving on active duty as an RC member, or accepted a new commission in an RC without a break in service.</p><p></p><p>2.  The officer certifies that the duty location or local area was designated in error as the HOR at the time of commission, and the home the Service member declares was the Service member’s HOR at the time of commission.</p><p></p><p>B.  Service Member Selects Alternate Out-Processing Station.  A Service member may select an alternate out-processing station to be released from active duty.  However, it must be authorized and approved through the Secretarial Process and conform to the individual Service policies.  If authorized and approved by the Secretary Concerned, a Service member: </p><p>1.  May travel from the last PDS to the processing station of choice and from there to his or her HOR or PLEAD and receive PCS travel and transportation allowances.  However, reimbursement is limited to the amount payable had the Service member been ordered to travel to, and separated at, the appropriate separation location as determined by the Service.</p><p></p><p>2.  Is authorized per diem or an actual expense allowance (AEA) away from the PDS during separation processing at the alternate station.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations Commissioned Personnel Center operates processing stations for NOAA.</p><p></p><p>C.  RC Member Released.  Dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are not authorized for an RC member who is released from active duty after he or she is ordered to active duty for either of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  Less than 20 weeks, including active duty for training.</p><p></p><p>2.  Training for 20 weeks or more at multiple locations, but the active duty is performed less than 20 weeks in any one location.</p><p></p><p>D.  Continuing or Re-Entering Service.  A Service member who separates or is released from active duty and then continues or re-enters Service may be authorized the travel and transportation allowances below.</p><p></p><p>1.  Separating to Continue in Service.  If a Service member separates or is released from active duty specifically to continue in another Service or in the same Service, as is the case in a re-enlistment, and must relocate on a PCS order, then PCS travel and transportation allowances for the Service member and dependent are authorized.  If the Service member does not have to relocate to continue service, then travel and transportation allowances are not authorized. </p><p></p><p>2.  Re-Entry into Service at Same Location Where Separated.  PCS Travel and transportation allowances are not authorized for a Service member who separates or is released from the Service at the end of his or her enlistment or term of service and then re-enters the Service at the same location where he or she separated or was released with no change in the PDS.</p><p></p><p>E.  Service Member Receives a Discharge or Separation Order While on Leave.  A Service member who travels on leave at personal expense and receives a DD214, “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,” or a separation order during his or her leave is authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances.  These allowances are paid from the Service member’s last PDS and not the leave location. </p><p></p><p>F.  Service Member Awaiting Disability Proceeding Results.  A Service member is authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances:</p><p></p><p>1.  To travel to a Government-ordered location, after signing a release not to contest the results of the initial physical evaluation board, and meets all of the following criteria:  </p><p></p><p>a.  Found unfit by a physical evaluation board to perform the duties of the Service member’s grade.</p><p></p><p>b.  Not authorized a home of selection (HOS) move.</p><p></p><p>c.  Ordered to that location for the Government’s convenience until the disability proceedings are complete.</p><p></p><p>2.  From the Government-ordered location to the location specified in the next issued order once a final disposition is reached in the disability proceedings.</p><p></p><p>3.  For a dependent to the Government-ordered location even if a disability separation order or other order is issued. </p><p></p><p>4.  For a dependent from the PDS (the PDS where the Service member received the order to proceed to the Government-ordered location) to that Government-ordered location and from there to the HOR or PLEAD when released from active duty.  However, the dependent’s travel is limited to the cost of traveling directly from the PDS where the Service member received the order to proceed to the Government-ordered location to the HOR or PLEAD. </p><p></p><p>G.  Service Member Selected for Undergraduate Program.  An enlisted Service member who is selected to pursue an undergraduate degree through the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) and separates from the Service due to that selection is authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances to the college.  The Service member may choose dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances to the college, the HOR, or the PLEAD </p><p></p><p>H.  Service Academy Cadet or Midshipman.  A cadet or midshipman, including a graduated cadet, who resigns, is dismissed, or is discharged is authorized standard PCS allowances for travel from the Service academy to the abode, home, or PDS, as appropriate. </p><p></p><p>I.  Service Member Contracts with an RC.  A Service member who separates from active duty to continue military service through a signed contract in an RC, may be authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances through the Secretarial Process to the designated Selected Reserve PDS, instead of limiting costs to the HOR or the PLEAD.</p><p></p><p>1.  This authority does not apply to a Service member who is separated or relieved from active duty and has served less than 90% of the enlisted active-duty period.</p><p></p><p>2.  No additional travel and transportation allowances are authorized once the RC contract is terminated. </p><p></p><p>J.  Service Member Served Less Than 90% of Enlistment or Commitment.  A Service member who is separated from the Service or released from active duty and has served less than 90% of his or her initial active-duty enlistment or initial service commitment receives no per diem for travel.  The Service member is authorized the same transportation for the dependent transportation that he or she receives, but no per diem.  Transportation allowances for the Service member and dependent are limited to transportation in-kind by the least costly mode available or, if transportation is personally procured, reimbursement is limited to the amount the Government would have paid for the least costly mode of transportation.  Exceptions to this policy include Service members who are: </p><p></p><p>1.  Retired due to a physical disability.</p><p></p><p>2.  Placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL) under 10 U.S.C. §1201-§1222, regardless of the length of time served.</p><p></p><p>3.

A medical condition affecting the Service member.</p><p></p><p>b.  A reduction in service time and under honorable conditions.</p><p></p><p>6.  Discharged for hardship under 10 U.S.C. §1173.</p><p></p><p>K.  Time Limitations for Separation.  A Service member and his or her dependent must begin travel to the HOR or PLEAD before the 181st day following separation from Service or release from active duty to receive separation allowances.  When travel before the 181st day would impose a hardship on the Service member, a time-limit extension may be authorized or approved for a specific time through the Secretarial Process.  The request for a time-limit extension must include the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  A description of the circumstances that prevent travel within the 180 days, the specific amount of additional time requested, and an acknowledgement that the extension is not being granted merely to accommodate personal preference or convenience.  The extension must be for the shortest time appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>2.  An extension cannot be authorized or approved if it extends travel and transportation allowances for more than 6 years from the date of separation, release from active duty or retirement, or from the date the Service member’s dependent receives an official notice that the Service member is dead, injured, missing, interned, or captured.  The only time the 6 years may be exceeded is when a Service member’s certified on-going medical condition prevents relocation of the dependent for longer than 6 years from the notification date. </p><p></p><p>051003.  Service Member on Active Duty who Retires, is Placed on the TDRL, is Discharged with Severance or Separation Pay, or is Involuntarily Released with Readjustment or Separation Pay and Associated Dependent Travel</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member and his or her dependent are authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances when the Service member is on active duty and meets any of the following conditions: </p><p></p><p>a.

When a PCS order is canceled, returning the Service member to the old PDS, PCS allowances are authorized from the old PDS to the location where the cancellation notification was received, and from that location back to the old PDS.  The amount payable is limited to travel from the old PDS, via any en route TDY locations and the first named PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Dependent Travel.  When a PCS order is amended or modified after the date the dependent begins travel and a new PDS is designated, or the PCS order is canceled or revoked, then dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized.  Allowances are payable for the distance from the place where the dependent began travel to the place where he or she received notification that the order was amended, modified, canceled, or revoked, and from that location to the new PDS or return to the old PDS.  This is limited to the travel and transportation allowances for the distance from the old PDS to the original new PDS and then to the PDS on the most recent order or return to the old PDS. </p><p>F.  Change of Activity.  A document directing a change of activity at the same PDS is not a PCS order, regardless of any statement on the document to the contrary. </p><p></p><p>051202.  Travel to or From a Designated Place</p><p></p><p>A.  Travel to or from a Designated Place.  A Service designated official may authorize or approve travel and transportation allowances to or from a designated place when the Service member must travel to the designated place en route between PDSs to assist in moving dependents, to assist dependents with HHG shipment, or to assist dependent transportation by POV.  The Service member must travel to the designated place before traveling to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>1.  The travel and transportation allowances authorized are from the old PDS to:</p><p></p><p>a.  The designated place and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The designated place to any TDY locations and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>c.  Any TDY locations to the designated place and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member cannot be paid PCS allowances for round-trip travel between a TDY location and a designated place. </p><p></p><p>3.  On the next PCS that results in dependent relocation, the Service member is authorized PCS allowances for travel from the old PDS to either any TDY location and the designated place and then to the new PDS or to the authorized processing station, if appropriate, then to the designated place, and then to the HOS, HOR, or PLEAD. </p><p></p><p>B.  Service Member no Longer Has Dependents.  If a Service member is divorced, or dependents die, before the next PCS order’s effective date and the Service member no longer has dependents at the designated place, the Service member may be authorized PCS allowances to travel to the designated place to pick up HHG, personal items, or the Service member’s or dependent’s POV. </p><p></p><p>051203.  PCS with TDY at a Location Near, but Outside the Limits of, the Old or New PDS  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  This paragraph applies when a Service member is ordered on a PCS with a TDY en route, and the TDY is near the old or new PDS or the TDY is at or near the home port when the PDS is a ship or afloat staff. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  No per diem is authorized if the Service member commutes to the TDY location from the quarters occupied while attached to the old PDS or from the permanent quarters the Service member intends to occupy at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>a.  Old PDS quarters are no longer permanent quarters on or after the PCS HHG weight allowance transportation date.</p><p></p><p>b.  New PDS quarters become permanent quarters on or after the date the PCS HHG weight allowance shipment is accepted. </p><p>2.  A Service member who is required to purchase meals at personal expense outside the PDS limits may be reimbursed for the cost as an occasional meal.  See par. 020305 for occasional meals. </p><p></p><p>3.  Transportation expense incurred in commuting between the quarters at the old or new PDS and the TDY location may be paid as specified in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member who detaches or signs out of the old PDS, performs a TDY en route elsewhere, and returns for a TDY en route to a location near the old PDS is authorized per diem at the location near the old PDS.  </p><p></p><p>051204.  PCS Travel Associated with Custody Change</p><p></p><p>Dependent travel and transportation allowances are not authorized for a dependent child who is not under the Service member’s legal custody and control on the PCS order’s effective date (B-131142, June 3, 1957).  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized when a Service member is granted legal custody or legal joint custody, or otherwise acquires custody lawfully after the effective date of his or her PCS order, such as when the custodial parent dies or when a child chooses to join a Service member after a court order lapses at age 18. </p><p></p><p>051205.  PCS Travel Associated with an Evacuation and Safety</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member Ordered on a PCS from a PDS from which Dependents have been Evacuated.  A Service-designated official may authorize or approve PCS travel and transportation allowances to a designated place or safe haven, as applicable, when the Service member is ordered on a PCS from a PDS where dependents were evacuated.  The Service member must travel to the designated place before he or she completes PCS travel.  </p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member may be authorized or approved to travel to the designated place or safe haven when he or she must assist in the transportation of a dependent or HHG, pick up personal items, or personally drive his or her POV.  The allowances authorized are from the old PDS to:</p><p></p><p>a.  The designated place or safe haven, and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The TDY location and then to the designated place or safe haven, and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>c.  The designated place or safe haven and then to the TDY location, and then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>d.  The authorized processing location, and then to the designated place or safe haven, and then to the HOS, HOR, or PLEAD, as applicable. </p><p></p><p>2.  Travel allowances cannot be paid for round-trip travel between a TDY location and a designated place or safe haven.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Service Member Ordered to a PDS in the CONUS Where Dependent Travel is Delayed or Restricted by an Ordered Evacuation or Natural Disaster </p><p></p><p>1.  The Services may request the designation of geographic areas within the CONUS as “non-concurrent travel application areas” when evacuations or major disasters occur, subject to approval by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (ASD(M&amp;RA)).  This authority is used when military installations or the surrounding geographic areas infrastructure cannot support the dependent at the duty location (see DoDI 1315.18 (Military Personnel Assignments)).  Service M&amp;RAs must request non-concurrent travel restriction authority through the Joint Chiefs of Staff or J1 for further coordination with the Services concerned, including Coast Guard, before submitting a recommendation to the ASD(M&amp;RA) for concurrence, approval, and adjudication.  Non-DoD Services are not subject to the DoDI, but should coordinate their policies with ASD(M&amp;RA) for uniformity among Service members.  See section 0509 and par. 051202 when the Service member travels on a PCS order from the old PDS via the dependent’s designated place before reporting to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>2.  When the dependent travels on a PCS order en route to the new PDS that is within the designated non-concurrent travel area, and a concurrent travel restriction is imposed on travel to the new PDS, the dependent enters into an “awaiting further transportation” status.  The Service member selects an “awaiting further transportation” location for the dependent.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances at the “awaiting further transportation” location are the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.  PCS allowances from the “awaiting further transportation” location to a designated place or the new PDS are authorized. </p><p></p><p>3.  Designation of an area in the CONUS as a “non-concurrent travel application area.”  Upon this designation of an area in the CONUS, dependent travel to locations within the area is not authorized at Government expense until authorized or approved by the Installation Commander or designee.  The Service member’s new commanding officer may authorize or approve additional travel time when appropriate according to Service policy.  Section 0509 and par. 051202 are not applicable when the designated place has not been declared. </p><p></p><p>4.  Delayed Dependent Travel between PDSs in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>a.  PCS Order.  The Service member’s PCS order must state that dependent travel to the new PDS must be authorized or approved by the Installation Commander or designee before travel may begin.  Once the Installation Commander or designee authorizes or approves the dependent travel, the PCS order must be modified or amended to reflect the change.  </p><p></p><p>b.  Delay Anticipated to Be for Less than 20 Weeks from the Service Member’s Reporting Date.  When the anticipated dependent travel delay is less than 20 weeks from the Service member’s reporting date, the dependent is expected to remain at the old PDS and moves to any other location at Government expense are not authorized. </p><p></p><p>c.  Delay Anticipated to Be for 20 or More Weeks from the Member’s Reporting Date.  When the authority designated through the Secretarial Process denies dependent travel for 20 or more weeks from the Service member’s reporting date, the dependent is authorized to move from the old PDS to an authorized designated place.  The PCS order must be modified to reflect the authorized designated place.  A non-foreign designated place OCONUS may be authorized through the Secretarial Process when both of the following occur: </p><p></p><p>(1)  The domicile of the Service member or spouse before entering active duty, or marriage to the Service member, was at the non-foreign location OCONUS requested as the designated place.</p><p></p><p>(2)  That non-foreign location OCONUS continues to be the Service member’s or spouse’s domicile.  </p><p></p><p>5.  Delayed Dependent Travel from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS.  When the old PDS is OCONUS and dependent travel is delayed, regardless of the duration, the dependent is authorized to move from the old PDS OCONUS to an authorized designated place in the CONUS.  A non-foreign designated place OCONUS may be authorized by the Installation Commander when the domicile of the Service member or spouse before entering active duty (or marriage to the Service member) was at the non-foreign location OCONUS and that non-foreign location OCONUS continues to be the Service member’s or spouse’s domicile.  The PCS order must state that dependent travel to the new PDS in the CONUS is not authorized until the Installation Commander or designee authorizes or approves further travel.  When travel to the new PDS is authorized or approved, the PCS order must be modified or amended.  </p><p></p><p>6.  Delayed Dependent Travel within a Designated Non-concurrent Travel Area.  This subparagraph applies when the old and new PDSs in the CONUS are non-concurrent dependent travel locations due to an ordered evacuation or natural disaster.</p><p></p><p>a.  Delay Anticipated to Be for Less than 20 Weeks from the Service Member’s Reporting Date.  When the anticipated dependent travel delay is less than 20 weeks from the Service member’s reporting date, dependent travel to any other location at Government expense is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>b.  Delay Anticipated to Be for 20 or More Weeks from the Service Member’s Reporting Date.  When the Secretarial Process denies dependent travel for 20 or more weeks from the Service member’s reporting date, the dependent is authorized travel from the old PDS to an authorized designated place.  The PCS order must reflect the authorized designated place.  A non-foreign designated place OCONUS may be authorized through the Secretarial Process when both of the following occur: </p><p></p><p>(1)  The domicile of the Service member or spouse before entering active duty, or marriage to the Service member, was at that non-foreign location OCONUS requested as the designated place.</p><p></p><p>(2)  That non-foreign location OCONUS continues to be the Service member’s or spouse’s domicile.  </p><p></p><p>7.  Dependent Travels to an Alternate Location other than the Authorized Designated Non-concurrent Travel Area in the CONUS </p><p></p><p>a.  When a dependent travels (separately or as a family) to a location not authorized or before an amended or modified PCS order is issued, then he or she can be reimbursed for travel and transportation only when a PCS order is issued that authorizes the dependent’s travel to the new PDS.  This applies when the dependent travels from any of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  the United States or a non-foreign PDS OCONUS from which the Service member is ordered when an expected delay is less than 20 weeks from the Service member’s reporting date.</p><p></p><p>(2)  the foreign PDS OCONUS from which the Service member is ordered, to a location other than the designated place when an expected delay is less than 20 weeks from the Service member’s reporting date.  A non-foreign designated place OCONUS may be authorized through the Secretarial Process when the domicile of the Service member or spouse before entering active duty (or marriage to the Service member) was at the non-foreign location OCONUS requested as the designated place and that domicile has not changed.</p><p></p><p>b.  When a dependent travels (separately or as a family) to a location other than the designated place before going to the PDS when an expected delay is 20 or more weeks from the Service member’s reporting date, then he or she is authorized travel and transportation allowances, limited to the Government’s travel and transportation costs directly from the last place the dependent was moved at Government expense to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>(1)  A non-foreign designated place OCONUS may be authorized through the Secretarial Process when the domicile of the Service member or spouse before entering active duty (or marriage to the Service member) was at a non-foreign location OCONUS requested as the designated place and the domicile has not changed.  </p><p></p><p>(2)  Section 0509 and par. 051202 do not apply when the dependent’s authorized designated place is unknown.  Excess travel costs involving the dependent-selected location are the Service member’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>C.  Travel and Transportation for a Dependent Relocating for Personal Safety .  The Service member’s spouse or a dependent child’s parent or court-appointed guardian may request relocation for personal safety and may be authorized travel and transportation allowances under this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>1.  Definitions</p><p></p><p>a.  Dependent Child</p><p></p><p>(1)  Dependent or acquired dependent as defined in Appendix A.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A Service member’s unmarried child who was transported to the Service member’s PDS at Government expense and who, due to age, graduation, or termination of enrollment in an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be the Service member’s dependent while the Service member was serving at that location.</p><p></p><p>b.  Dependent Abuse Offense (10 U.S.C. §1059(c)).  A “dependent abuse offense” is a criminal conduct by a Service member on active duty for 31 or more days that involves abuse of the spouse or dependent child.  This criminal offense is specified in regulation prescribed by the Secretary of Defense under 10 U.S.C. §1059(k).</p><p></p><p>2.  Relocation may be authorized if the Service-designated official determines that:</p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member has committed a dependent abuse offense against a Service member’s dependent.</p><p></p><p>b.  A safety plan and counseling have been provided to the dependent.</p><p></p><p>c.  The dependent’s safety is at risk.</p><p></p><p>d.  Dependent relocation is advisable.</p><p></p><p>e.  Dependent relocation is in the Government’s best interest and that of the Service member or dependent.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>a.  Transportation for the Service member’s dependent, baggage, and HHG may be authorized from the PDS to the designated relocation site in the United States, or its possessions, or if the dependent is a foreign national to the dependent’s native country when a PCS order has not been issued, or when it has been issued, but cannot be used for this transportation.</p><p></p><p>(1)  Transportation in-kind, transportation reimbursement, or MALT Plus, is authorized for the dependent.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Transportation of HHG in NTS to the designated relocation site may be authorized.</p><p>b.  If the Service member’s PDS is OCONUS, transportation may be authorized for one POV that is owned or leased by the Service member or dependent and is for the Service member’s dependent’s personal use.</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG or POV transportation may be authorized only if the Service member’s written agreement, or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, grants HHG or POV possession to the Service member’s spouse or dependent.</p><p></p><p>4.  Reimbursement.  All monetary payments, except DLA (which is not authorized for dependents moving for personal safety) are paid directly to the dependent instead of to the Service member (37 U.S.C. §476(h)(4)(A)).</p><p></p><p>051206.  Limited PCS Allowances for a Selected Reserve Member </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is filling a vacancy in a Selected Reserve unit at a duty location that is more than 150 miles from his or her primary residence may be eligible for limited PCS allowances.  Additionally, to be eligible for the limited PCS allowances, the Service member must:</p><p></p><p>1.  Have been involuntarily separated under other than adverse conditions, as defined by the Secretary concerned, that occurred in all of the following time frames:</p><p></p><p>a.

Be filling a vacancy in a Selected Reserve unit with a critical manpower shortage or be qualified in a skill designated as critically short by the Secretary concerned.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  All PCS travel and transportation allowances in this paragraph may be provided to a Service member only once and are funded by the Selected Reserve unit filling the vacancy. </p><p></p><p>1.  Standard PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized for the Service member and his or her dependent, including HHG transportation and SIT.  A funds advance may be made for these allowances. </p><p></p><p>2.  There is no authorization for DLA, TLE, or POV shipment or storage. </p><p></p><p>051207.  Indeterminate Temporary Duty (ITDY) </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member and a dependent may be eligible for travel allowances when the Service member is traveling in connection with an indeterminate TDY (ITDY).  Only a Service headquarters can authorize or approve an ITDY.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member at the ITDY location receives allowances in section 0312.</p><p></p><p>1.  General Allowances </p><p></p><p>a.  DLA is payable to a Service member when a dependent relocates under an ITDY order.  See section 0505 for DLA specifics.</p><p></p><p>b.  Dependent transportation is authorized under this paragraph the same as for PCS.  </p><p></p><p>c.  The MALT in par. 050203 applies unless the dependent accompanies the Service member to the TDY location traveling in the same POV.  If the dependent travels as a passenger, no MALT is payable for the dependent since the Service member receives PCS mileage.</p><p></p><p>d.  HHG Transportation.  See par. 031201 for HHG transportation.</p><p></p><p>2.  Travel to or from the Old PDS or Alternate Place En Route to the ITDY Location.  A Service member may be authorized PCS travel and transportation allowances to accompany a dependent to the alternate place from the old PDS.  The Service member’s travel must be determined through the Secretarial Process as necessary to assist the dependent and not for personal convenience.  The Service member may travel to the dependent’s alternate place while en route to an ITDY location when authorized through the Secretarial Process and only to help the dependent move from one location to another when the move is, or was, at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>a.  When authorized, the Service member may accompany the dependent to the alternate place while en route to the ITDY location, or as a separate PCS round trip between the old PDS and alternate place at Government expense before departing on the ITDY order (B-199354, July 1, 1981).</p><p></p><p>b.  Travel and transportation allowances are not authorized for travel before the official written ITDY order is issued.

Return to the old PDS before travel to the new PDS via the alternate place must be stated in the Service member’s order or authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>b.  It must be determined through the Secretarial Process that it is necessary for the Service member to assist the dependent in relocating to the PDS and not for personal convenience, such as a visit.  Arranging an HHG or POV shipment is not an authorized reason.</p><p></p><p>c.  Dependent travel reimbursement is limited to travel directly from the alternate location to either the old PDS or the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>d.  If the dependent was not relocated to an alternate place and stayed at the PDS from which the Service member departed on ITDY, the Service member receives PCS travel and transportation allowances from the ITDY location via the old PDS to the new PDS, if the new PDS is known.</p><p></p><p>e.  The Service member’s PCS travel and transportation allowances between the ITDY location and alternate place or previous PDS where the dependent is located is limited to the Government’s constructed cost.  POV travel is not usually authorized to the alternate location or previous PDS from the ITDY location.  </p><p></p><p>f.  Travel and transportation reimbursement is not authorized when the Service member reports to the new PDS on a subsequent PCS travel order before accompanying the dependent.  The Service member is financially responsible for the travel and transportation expenses to the alternate place or previous PDS to accompany the dependent.</p><p></p><p>4.  Service Member Returns to the Old PDS </p><p></p><p>a.  When the ITDY ends, and the Service member receives an order to return to the old PDS, he or she may travel to where the dependent was last moved at Government expense to assist with dependent travel and transportation en route to the old PDS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  Return transportation from the CONUS to a PDS OCONUS must not be authorized or approved unless at least 12 months remain in the Service member’s tour of duty at that PDS on the later of the following dates:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Day the dependent is scheduled to arrive at that PDS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Day the dependent actually arrives at that PDS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Day when command sponsorship is granted again.</p><p></p><p>5.  Dependent Travel</p><p></p><p>a.  Dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances to an alternate place at Government expense, as specified in Table 5-34, are for the dependent to establish a permanent residence during the Service member’s ITDY.  Such travel may be authorized at Government expense according to Agency or Service regulations when one of the following apply:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member is on an ITDY order.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The Service member’s TDY order does not provide for return to the PDS and either the TDY is expected to be for 20 or more weeks at any one location (except as in par. 010206)  or the TDY order does not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from the PDS. </p><p>b.  When a dependent is moved at Government expense to the ITDY location or other alternate place and the Service member receives a PCS order at the ITDY location, dependent PCS travel and transportation allowances are authorized for travel to the new PDS, limited to the cost from the ITDY location or alternate place to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-34.

Included in this section is the policy for the actual transportation or relocation of HHG, storage of HHG, and the various transportation methods available.  Also in this section are the allowances for transportation of unaccompanied baggage; professional books, papers and equipment (PBP&amp;E); and required medical equipment.  A Service member is authorized transportation of HHG when moving is necessary due to a permanent change of station (PCS) or other reasons in this section.  </p><p></p><p>0513  STANDARD ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>051301.  Basic Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Government’s Maximum Obligation.  A Service member can move his or her HHG in as many lots as desired from one or more locations.  However, the Government’s obligation, and maximum payment, is what the cost would be to transport the Service member’s maximum weight allowance between authorized locations in one lot at the Government’s “Best Value” cost.  For a U.S. Public Health Service member, the limitation is   to the Government’s “Best Value,” the overall lowest cost, or other USPHS-selected method.  DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value) contains details on “Best Value” costs, including when a boat or personal watercraft exceeding 14 feet, with the trailer, is transported as HHG. </p><p></p><p>B.  Authorized Locations.  Authorized locations include, but are not limited to, any combination of the locations in Table 5-35. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-35.  Authorized Locations to Send or Receive HHG</p><p>1</p><p>Origin is from a:</p><p>a.  Residence or quarters to a packing, crating, or storage facility.</p><p>b.  Packing or crating facility to quarters or residence when a portion of the HHG, after being packed and crated, is to join the remainder of the HHG</p><p>c.  Packing or crating facility to a storage facility.</p><p>d.  Residence or quarters to a carrier’s location.</p><p>e.  Packing, crating, or storage facility to a carrier’s location.</p><p>2</p><p>En route or </p><p>in-transit from:</p><p>a.  The incoming carrier’s location to a storage facility.</p><p>b.  A storage facility to an outgoing carrier’s location.</p><p>c.  An incoming carrier’s location to an outgoing carrier’s location.</p><p>3</p><p>Destination </p><p>from the:</p><p>a.  Carrier’s location to a residence or quarters, or a storage location.</p><p>b.  Storage location to a residence or quarters.</p><p></p><p>C.  Re-Transportation of HHG.  Once the Government has transported HHG, no further transportation of that HHG is authorized under the same order for a Service member’s convenience to another place. </p><p></p><p>D.  Additional Transportation.  If a Service member does not transport the total authorized HHG weight allowance to a new permanent duty station (PDS), the remainder of the weight allowance can be transported at a later date.  The HHG must have been in the Service member’s possession before the effective date of the PCS order from the PDS where the HHG was not transported.  The Government’s cost to transport the HHG is limited to the cost to transport the PCS weight allowance in one lot from the old PDS to the new PDS.  See PDT computation example 8.</p><p></p><p>E.  HHG Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed.  Replacement HHG, up to the full weight allowance, may be transported when the original HHG shipment is destroyed or lost during transportation through no fault of the Service member.  The replacement HHG is transported as though the original shipment was improperly transported or unavoidably separated from the Service member.  If HHG is lost, damaged, or destroyed while being transported by the Government, claims are submitted as specified in Service regulations. </p><p></p><p>051302.  Effect of an Order Issuance on HHG Transportation</p><p></p><p>A.  Impact of Order Effective Date.  HHG allowances are based on the PCS order’s effective date; although, the HHG may be transported as long as the HHG authority remains in effect.  The weight allowance is based on the grade held on the effective date of the order authorizing the HHG transportation.  See par. 051401 for a Service member reduced in grade. </p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Transportation before an Order Is Issued</p><p></p><p>1.  HHG transportation before a PCS order is issued is authorized if the request for transportation is supported by all of the following: </p><p></p><p>a.  A statement from the AO or designated representative that the Service member was advised before such an order was issued that it would be issued. </p><p></p><p>b.  A written agreement, signed by the applicant, to pay any additional costs incurred for transportation to another point required because the new PDS named in the order is different than that named in the AO’s statement. </p><p></p><p>c.  A written agreement, signed by the applicant, to pay the entire transportation cost if a PCS order is not later issued to authorize the transportation. </p><p></p><p>2.  The length of time before the PCS order is issued, during which a Service member may be advised that an order is to be issued, is limited to the relatively short period between the time when a determination is made to order the Service member to make a PCS and the date the order is actually issued. </p><p></p><p>3.  HHG transportation before a PCS order is issued is authorized for a Service member assigned to a ship that has been scheduled for an overhaul, if the AO or designated representative provides a statement that the ship’s home port is to be changed due to the overhaul.  This statement may be issued when there are fewer than 90 days between the time when a specific overhaul site is determined and the actual ship’s departure to the overhaul site.  If the scheduled ship overhaul is canceled, HHG must be transported to the proper destination at Government expense (59 Comp. Gen. 509 (1980)).  </p><p></p><p>4.  General information furnished to the Service member concerning order issuance before the determination is made to actually issue the order (such as time of eventual release from active duty, time of service term expiration, eligibility date for retirement, or expected rotation date from duty OCONUS) is not advice that the order is to be issued and cannot be used as a reason to transport HHG before the PCS order is issued (52 Comp. Gen. 769 (1973)).  </p><p></p><p>C.  Time Limitation.  Unless otherwise specified in the JTR, a Service member’s HHG transportation authority may be used any time while the order remains in effect and before receipt of another PCS order, as long as the HHG transportation is due to the Service member’s PCS rather than for personal reasons (45 Comp. Gen. 589 (1966)) and B-183436, July 22, 1975). </p><p></p><p>D.  Order Amended, Modified, Canceled, or Revoked.  HHG transported after a PCS order is received must be shipped to the proper destination at Government expense if the order is later amended, modified, canceled, or revoked. </p><p></p><p>051303.  Alcohol and Firearms</p><p></p><p>A.  Alcoholic Beverage Transportation.  Alcoholic beverage transportation as HHG must conform to 27 U.S.C. §122. </p><p></p><p>B.  Firearm Transportation.  Transportation of firearms as HHG for an Armed Services member must conform to 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(6), (8), and (9).  Department of Defense (DoD) Services see DoDI 6400.06 (Domestic Abuse) for additional information.  Non-DoD personnel should see Service regulations.  </p><p></p><p>051304.  Professional Books, Papers and Equipment (PBP&amp;E) and Required Medical Equipment</p><p></p><p>A.  PBP&amp;E.  A Service member is authorized PBP&amp;E when he or she certifies that the PBP&amp;E are necessary for official duty at the next PDS.  The next PDS includes the home of record (HOR) or home of selection (HOS) upon leaving the Service.  PBP&amp;E must be declared at the origin of the shipment, and must be documented (to include certification or approval) according to Agency or Service transportation procedures.</p><p></p><p>1.  The weight of PBP&amp;E is not included in the maximum authorized HHG weight allowance.  The PBP&amp;E maximum weight allowed is limited to 2,000 pounds net weight.  This limit was effective May 2014, and cannot be waived or increased except as specified below.  </p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member may exceed the 2,000 pound weight limit when returning from outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or executing a consecutive overseas tour (COT) if orders OCONUS were issued before May 1, 2014. </p><p></p><p>b.  PBP&amp;E over 2,000 pounds must have been originally shipped at Government expense to the location OCONUS.  The Service member may ship the same amount of PBP&amp;E that was originally shipped OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Once PBP&amp;E shipped OCONUS are returned to the continental United States (CONUS), there is no authorization or waiver authority to exceed the 2,000-pound limit on a later order. </p><p></p><p>3.  The obligation to return PBP&amp;E is limited to the amount of PBP&amp;E the Government initially authorized to be shipped OCONUS, even if that is less than the 2,000-pound maximum limit. </p><p></p><p>4.  The Service member may request through the Secretarial Process that PBP&amp;E belonging to his or her spouse be shipped at Government expense on a PCS move.  If approved, the spouse’s PBP&amp;E authorized maximum weight is limited to 500 pounds. </p><p></p><p>5.  PBP&amp;E is transported the same way, and to the same authorized locations, as HHG.  Transportation may be expedited when shipped as unaccompanied baggage.  If an item no longer qualifies as PBP&amp;E, it is considered to be PBP&amp;E for the next PCS, and then is HHG for any subsequent moves.  If an item of HHG becomes an item that should be PBP&amp;E but is not declared and documented as PBP&amp;E before the HHG transportation or for that move, the item is included in the HHG weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>B.  Required Medical Equipment.  A Service member or a dependent who is entitled to, and receiving, medical care authorized by 10 U.S.C. §1071-§1110 may ship medical equipment necessary for such care.  The medical equipment may be shipped in the same way as HHG, but has no weight limit.  The weight of authorized medical equipment is not included in the maximum authorized HHG weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>1.  Required medical equipment does not include a modified personally owned vehicle.</p><p></p><p>2.  For medical equipment to qualify for shipment under this paragraph, an appropriate Uniformed Services healthcare provider must certify that the equipment is necessary for medical treatment of the Service member or the dependent who is authorized medical care under 10 U.S.C. §1071-§1110. </p><p></p><p>051305.  HHG Transportation Not Allowed</p><p></p><p>A.  No Authority.  There is no authority for HHG transportation under any of the following conditions for a Service member: </p><p></p><p>1.  Of a Reserve Component when called or ordered to active duty, including active duty for training, for either of the following durations:</p><p></p><p>a.  Less than 20 weeks.</p><p></p><p>b.  20 or more weeks when the active duty is for less than 20 weeks at any one location.</p><p></p><p>2.  On leave.</p><p></p><p>3.  Who is absent without leave, a deserter, a Straggler, dropped or dismissed, transferred as a prisoner to a place of detention, or in confinement, except as in par. 052009 and Table 5-22.</p><p></p><p>4.  Due to a court-martial, sentence, or resignation, or an administrative discharge under conditions other than honorable when the Service member is serving in the CONUS and has no dependents.  For a Service member who has dependents, see par. 052009 and Table 5-22.</p><p></p><p>5.  Under an order to attend a course of instruction of less than 20 weeks, except when HHG at the TDY weight allowance is authorized.</p><p></p><p>6.  Called or ordered to active duty for basic training for less than 6 months. </p><p></p><p>7.  When a tour OCONUS is for less than 12 months, or less than 12 months remain in a tour OCONUS after the scheduled HHG arrival date at the PDS.  An exception allowing HHG shipment is when:</p><p></p><p>a.  Authorization is granted through the Secretarial Process if the HHG shipping time uses a portion of the 12 months at the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member is reassigned OCONUS before the specified tour OCONUS is completed due to base closure or similar action in accordance with par. 050807.</p><p></p><p>c.  A Service member is attending a course of instruction, including Foreign Service schools, for 20 or more weeks in accordance with par. 052008.</p><p></p><p>d.  The Secretarial Process authorizes a reduced administrative HHG weight transportation, limited to 10% of the Service member’s full HHG weight allowance on an individual basis when Government furnishings or quarters are not available at the PDS for PCS travel unless otherwise indicated at Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations.  The authorization for the reduced administrative HHG weight allowance must be in writing before the official travel.  Consider more cost-effective options first, such as transporting it as excess accompanied baggage.</p><p></p><p>8.  Transferred between PDSs in proximity to, or activities at, the same PDS, unless a short distance move is authorized under section 0519.</p><p></p><p>B.  Locations in the CONUS to which HHG Transportation is Prohibited</p><p></p><p>1.  Authorization.  A Service member, ordered to duty at a location in the CONUS to which HHG transportation is prohibited or where dependents are not permitted to join the Service member within 20 weeks, is authorized HHG transportation from the last PDS to a designated place in the CONUS and non-temporary storage (NTS).</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation from the Designated Place and NTS.  When the restriction is removed or the Service member is ordered on a PCS to a PDS to which HHG transportation is permitted, transportation is authorized to the PDS from the designated place and NTS.</p><p></p><p>051306.  Excess Charges</p><p></p><p>A.  Government’s Responsibility</p><p></p><p>1.  The Government may pay the total transportation cost and other applicable charges for any weight that exceeds the weight allowance.  The Government must collect the excess costs from the Service member.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member must repay the Service for the cost of transporting his or her HHG in excess of the specified weight allowance, unless there is specific authorization for an increased weight allowance, limited to 18,000 pounds.</p><p></p><p>3.  All transportation costs are included in determining excess costs, such as storage, accessorial services, and any other costs that the Government paid to move the HHG.</p><p></p><p>4.  When it is known or suspected that a Service member will exceed the maximum weight allowance before transportation, the Transportation Officer should notify the Service member and the office paying for the transportation.  The Service member is financially responsible for the excess weight charges even if the Transportation Officer did not notify the Service member or the AO providing transportation funds of the known or suspected excess weight status before transportation (CBCA 2076-RELO, October 5, 2010). </p><p></p><p>B.  Determining Service Member’s Excess Cost</p><p></p><p>Table 5-36.  HHG Transportation in Excess of Authorized Weight Allowance</p><p>If…</p><p>And…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>shipping to or from an area with no administrative weight restrictions,</p><p>HHG is transported in one shipment, and no HHG is placed in NTS, and excess weight is involved,</p><p>compute the total transportation cost, less the transportation cost of unauthorized items as determined in par. 051306-D.  The cost of excess net weight is prorated based on the cost of total net weight transported.</p><p>2</p><p></p><p>HHG is shipped in multiple shipments with excess weight involved,</p><p>compute the excess cost on the shipment so that it results in the lowest cost to the Service member.</p><p>3</p><p>shipping to or from an administratively weight-restricted area,</p><p>weight in excess of the administrative weight allowance is transported to or from the area OCONUS, </p><p>compute the excess costs on the overseas and transoceanic portions of the transportation.  Compute the cost of the excess weight so that it results in the lowest cost to the Service member.</p><p>4</p><p></p><p>individual shipments are within the administrative weight allowance but when all shipments are added together, the total exceeds the Service member’s authorized weight allowance,</p><p>compute the excess cost on the shipment so that it results in the lowest cost to the Service member.</p><p>See PDT computation example 9</p><p></p><p>C.  HHG Transportation Other than between Authorized Locations</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member may have HHG transported between any locations.  This also applies to a Service member on an order from an administratively weight-restricted area.  The Government’s cost, other than between authorized locations, is limited to the ‘Best Value’ cost of transporting the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot for whichever of the following results in the lowest cost to the Government:</p><p></p><p>a.  From the last PDS to the new PDS or home of the legal heir.</p><p></p><p>b.  From the actual HHG location to the new PDS or home of the legal heir.</p><p></p><p>2.  When HHG is transported to a designated place at Government expense and later moved to another location at personal expense, excess HHG transportation costs for the next PCS are based on the transportation cost of the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance from the designated place to the new PDS.  If the Service member personally procures transportation for HHG from the designated place to the new PDS, the incentive or reimbursement is based on the Government’s constructed cost of the actual weight moved, limited to the PCS weight allowance.  See PDT computation example 10.</p><p></p><p>D.  Transportation of Unauthorized Items.  Non-HHG items must be transported apart from authorized HHG, and the Service member must make the arrangements for separate transportation.  If non-HHG items are transported in the HHG shipment and later disclosed or discovered, the Service member is financially responsible for all identifiable transportation costs for the items.  If the transportation cost of the items cannot be established, the weight of the non-HHG items is considered excess weight and the transportation cost is computed as specified in Table 5-36.</p><p></p><p>E.  HHG Transportation with Special Routing or Services Provided</p><p></p><p>1.  When the Service member requests and is provided special routing or services, he or she is financially responsible for the transportation cost above the cost of transporting the HHG without the special routing or services.</p><p></p><p>2.  Subject to the provisions for excess charges and upon the written request of a Service member or a deceased Service member’s heir and his or her agreement to pay any additional cost, he or she may:</p><p></p><p>a.  Turn over the HHG to a Transportation Officer for transportation at different times to the same destination.</p><p></p><p>b.  Have special services used, such as additional valuation, specific routing, special loading, and other special or accessorial services that may involve additional expenses.</p><p></p><p>c.  Have transportation between any points, limited to the Government’s constructed cost.  However, this option does not apply to HHG if the Service member is not authorized a move to the HOS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Have one final HHG shipment of items legally awarded to a former spouse due to a divorce when a Service member is authorized transportation under a PCS order, including separation and retirement (61 Comp. Gen. 180 (1981)).</p><p></p><p>F.  Transportation Costs Caused by Negligence.  Transportation-related costs incurred by the Government due to the negligence of the Service member or the Service member’s agent, such as attempted pickup or delivery charges when the carrier could not pick up or deliver the HHG as scheduled, are considered excess charges and are the Service member’s responsibility.</p><p></p><p>G.  Weight Additive Items.  When HHG includes an item for which a carrier assesses a weight additive, the weight additive is added to the shipment’s actual net weight each time the weight is computed.  It becomes part of the weight shipped for comparison against the weight allowance in section 0502.  Special packing, crating, or handling expenses for these items are the Service member’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>051307.  Advance of Funds</p><p></p><p>Advance payment of an operating allowance is authorized for personally procured HHG transportation depending on the type of move the Service member chooses.  An advance payment is authorized for any of the following: </p><p></p><p>A.  A monetary allowance equal to the constructed expenses for transportation arranged when Government-procured HHG transportation or NTS is not available.</p><p></p><p>B.  A monetary allowance equal to the constructed expenses, limited to 100% of the Government’s maximum obligation, for transportation arranged when Government-procured transportation and NTS is available but the Service member personally procures the HHG transportation.</p><p></p><p>C.  An amount equal to 60% of the personally procured move (PPM) monetary allowance when the Service member moves his or herself.  Under the PPM monetary allowance, the Service member or next of kin, as appropriate, receives payment of an amount equal to 95% of the Government’s constructed “Best Value” cost for the actual HHG weight transported up to the Service member’s maximum authorized weight allowance.</p><p></p><p>0514  HHG WEIGHT</p><p></p><p>051401.  Authorized PCS Weight Allowances </p><p></p><p>The authorized PCS weight allowance is normally determined by a Service member’s grade on the effective date of the PCS order, and whether or not the Service member has dependents on the effective date of the PCS order.  This section also covers circumstances when the PCS weight allowance is based on other factors.</p><p></p><p>A.  Composition.  Table 5-37 specifies the authorized weight allowances for a Service member.  The weight allowance for a Service member authorized in this table is the total combined weight of any HHG shipped, plus any unaccompanied baggage shipped, and any HHG in storage.  See PDT computation example 11.</p><p></p><p>1.  The weight of PBP&amp;E and required medical equipment is not included in the HHG weight allowance authorized.  See par. 051304 for details on PBP&amp;E and required medical equipment.</p><p></p><p>2.  The weight of accompanied baggage or excess accompanied baggage is also not included in the authorized weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Eligible to Travel.  For , a Service member with dependents is one who has a dependent eligible to travel at Government expense due to a PCS, regardless if the dependent actually travels.  For a Service member’s first PCS after either the death of all of the Service member’s dependents, or a divorce that leaves the Service member with no dependents eligible to travel at Government expense, the Service  member’s weight allowance remains at the with-dependent rate. </p><p></p><p>C.  Grade Determination.  A Service member appointed from either an enlisted or warrant officer grade to a commissioned officer grade, or from an enlisted grade to a warrant officer grade, is authorized the greater of the weight allowance for the grade held on the PCS order effective date or for the grade held at the time the appointment was accepted.  If the Service member’s grade reverts to the prior grade, he or she is authorized the greater of those two weight allowances.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Special Senior Enlisted Members.  A Service member selected as Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sergeant Major of the Army, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, or Senior Enlisted Advisor to the National Guard Bureau is authorized a weight allowance of 17,000 pounds with dependents or 14,000 pounds without dependents for a PCS order issued on or after receiving notice of selection to that position.  The Service member is authorized these weight allowances for the remainder of his or her military career. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-37.  PCS and NTS Weight Allowances (Pounds)</p><p>Grade</p><p>With Dependents</p><p>Without Dependents</p><p>1</p><p>0-10 to 0-6</p><p>18,000</p><p>18,000</p><p>2</p><p>0-5 or W-5</p><p>17,500</p><p>16,000</p><p>3</p><p>0-4 or W-4</p><p>17,000</p><p>14,000</p><p>4</p><p>0-3 or W-3</p><p>14,500</p><p>13,000</p><p>5</p><p>0-2 or W-2</p><p>13,500</p><p>12,500</p><p>6</p><p>0-1, W-1, or Service Academy Graduate</p><p>12,000</p><p>10,000</p><p>7</p><p>E-9</p><p>15,000</p><p>13,000</p><p>8</p><p>E-8</p><p>14,000</p><p>12,000</p><p>9</p><p>E-7</p><p>13,000</p><p>11,000</p><p>10</p><p>E-6</p><p>11,000</p><p>8,000</p><p>11</p><p>E-5</p><p>9,000</p><p>7,000</p><p>12</p><p>E-4</p><p>8,000</p><p>7,000</p><p>13</p><p>E-3 to E-1</p><p>8,000</p><p>5,000</p><p>14</p><p>Aviation Cadet</p><p>8,000</p><p>7,000</p><p>15</p><p>Service Academy Cadet or Midshipman</p><p></p><p>350</p><p></p><p>051402.  Exceptions to the Authorized Weight Allowance</p><p></p><p>A.  Administrative Weight Limitations</p><p></p><p>1.  The weight allowances can be administratively restricted at a PDS OCONUS based on factors at that location.  Such factors include whether HHG is supplied at the PDS, if there is limited space for HHG in Government quarters or private-sector housing, and if there is limited storage for excess HHG in the area.  See Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations. </p><p></p><p>2.  Services establish item allowances for a specific location.  Services must coordinate so that allowances are uniform for all Service members of all Services by grade and dependency status in the area. </p><p></p><p>3.  When the new PDS is an administrative-weight-limited location, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation to a designated place or to NTS for the remainder of the HHG weight allowance in  that could not be shipped to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>B.  Administrative Weight Limitations not Applicable.  Administrative weight limitations do not apply to: </p><p></p><p>1.  HHG shipments from non-foreign areas OCONUS to any location where there is no administrative weight limitation.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member with a weight allowance of less than 2,500 pounds.</p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member on duty as a U.S. Defense Attaché.</p><p></p><p>C.  Exceptions to Administrative Weight Limitations.  A Service member may request an exception to the administrative weight limitation through the Secretarial Process when the weight listed at Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations for the location is insufficient.  The combined weights of the HHG shipped and those in NTS cannot exceed the Service member’s weight allowance authorized in .  Exceptions may be granted in the following circumstances: </p><p></p><p>1.  Items normally furnished by the Government at the new PDS are unavailable.  The administrative weight allowance is increased in an amount equal to the weight of personally owned substitute furnishings. </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is assigned to a consecutive overseas tour (COT) from an unrestricted-weight location to an administrative-weight-limitation location.  The Secretarial Process review must ensure that the HHG transportation does not result in extra costs to the Government. </p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member extends a tour for 1 year or longer within the same weight limitation location. </p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member departs from an administrative-weight-limitation location and he or she had acquired additional furnishings through marriage after assignment to that location.  A Service member who acquires a dependent after the effective date of the PCS order to an administrative-weight-limitation location is not authorized transportation for the acquired dependent’s HHG or an increase in the weight allowance to that PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>5.  The Service determines that circumstances exist that would cause undue hardship if the administrative weight limit was enforced. </p><p></p><p>D.  Unaccompanied Tour Administrative Weight Limitations</p><p></p><p>1.  Requests for unaccompanied tour location weight limitations must specify:</p><p></p><p>a.  The location where the weight allowance is to be limited.</p><p></p><p>b.  The proposed new administrative weight allowed and the reasons for the HHG weight allowance reduction.</p><p></p><p>c.  The effective period for the decreased weight allowance.</p><p></p><p>d.  The Services affected by the request and the results of the coordination with those Services.</p><p></p><p>2.  Requests must be coordinated locally and then coordinated through the Secretarial Process of each affected Service.  Once coordinated through all of the affected Services, the request is then sent to the PDTATAC MAP and CAP members for final review and determination.  After the PDTATAC MAP and CAP members approve a weight-limitation request, the location will be listed at Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations.  Weight restrictions for locations not listed are not valid.</p><p></p><p>3.  All Services at a location are equally affected by any approved weight restriction.</p><p></p><p>E.  Higher Weight Allowances.  Each Service will designate either the Secretary concerned or the Secretarial Process as the approval authority level to authorize a higher weight allowance than that authorized in .  No general policy statements are permitted and higher weight allowances will be authorized only on an individual basis.  Any increase must meet all of the following requirements: </p><p></p><p>1.  Must be authorized only for a Service member in the pay grade O-5 or below.</p><p></p><p>2.  Is limited to a total HHG weight of 18,000 pounds.</p><p></p><p>3.  Must be documented in a written determination from the approval authority that failure to increase the Service member’s weight allowance would create a significant hardship to the Service member or dependent.</p><p></p><p>F.  Service Member Married to Another Service Member or Married to a Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>1.  Table 5-38 specifies the weight allowance limitations for a PCS HHG shipment when both spouses move to a location with an administrative weight allowance and both have PCS orders.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-38.  PCS Weight Allowance Limitations for a Service Member </p><p>Married to another Service Member or to a Civilian Employee</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>both Service members are currently assigned to the same PDS, or a nearby PDS in the same area where they jointly occupy a residence, and their new orders are both to the same PDS or nearby PDSs where they will jointly occupy a residence,</p><p>the couple is limited to one administrative weight allowance based on the higher-ranking Service member’s weight allowance.</p><p>2</p><p>both Service members are currently assigned to the same PDS or nearby PDSs where they jointly occupy a residence, but new orders are to different PDSs where they will occupy separate residences,</p><p>each Service member is individually authorized an administrative weight allowance.</p><p>3</p><p>both Service members are currently assigned to different PDSs and occupy separate residences, and the new orders are to the same or nearby PDSs where they will jointly occupy a residence,</p><p>each Service member is individually authorized an administrative weight allowance.</p><p>4</p><p>a Service member is married to another Service member,</p><p>each Service member is authorized unaccompanied baggage transportation, transportation of PBP&amp;E, and transportation of required medical equipment, if all other criteria are met.</p><p>5</p><p>one spouse is a Service member and the other spouse is a civilian employee,</p><p>the Service member’s administrative weight allowance is based on the higher PCS HHG weight allowance.  See par. 051402-A (FTR §302-7.2) for the civilian employee’s HHG allowance.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a Service member is married to another Service member, they may combine the weight allowances in  for HHG transportation and NTS when each has a PCS order between PDSs where they are maintaining or will maintain joint residences within commuting distance of the PDSs. </p><p></p><p>3.  For a move involving the separation or retirement of either or both Service members, the HHG weights may be combined if the move is to a joint residence and either of the following apply: </p><p></p><p>a.  The residence is in the new PDS vicinity of the Service member remaining on active duty from which that Service member will commute to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The residence is being established by both retiring or separating spouses at the HOS or HOR, limited by the lesser authorization.</p><p></p><p>4.  See par. 052010 if one of the Service members dies. </p><p></p><p>5.  See par. 051402-A  for HHG transportation for a civilian employee married to a Service member when both are authorized HHG shipments to the same new PDS. </p><p></p><p>051403.  Unaccompanied Baggage </p><p></p><p>A.  Weight Limitations.  Unaccompanied baggage is part of the Service member’s authorized HHG weight allowance.  When the shipment is to an area that has an administrative weight limit for HHG, the unaccompanied baggage weight is part of the administrative HHG weight limitation.  Unaccompanied baggage is subject to specific limitations.  If the new PDS is a location with an HHG administrative weight limit, the unaccompanied baggage weight is the lesser of either the administrative weight limit for the PDS location at Administrative HHG Weight Allowance Locations, or one of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  2,000 pounds for an active-duty Service member with command-sponsored family members.  The 2,000-pound weight limit is for the entire family, not for each traveler.</p><p></p><p>2.  10% of the authorized weight allowance for an unaccompanied active-duty Service member normally assigned to furnished Government quarters.</p><p></p><p>3.  2,000 pounds for an unaccompanied active-duty Service member not normally assigned to furnished bachelor enlisted quarters or bachelor officer quarters.</p><p></p><p>B.  Expedited Transportation.  Unaccompanied baggage transportation is authorized by an expedited transportation mode when necessary to enable the Service member to carry out assigned duties or to prevent undue hardship on the Service member or a dependent.  The unaccompanied baggage, including any PBP&amp;E, is limited to a maximum of 1,000 pounds when transported by commercial air.  If unaccompanied baggage is shipped by expedited commercial air, the remaining weight, limited to the unaccompanied baggage weight allowance authorized in this paragraph, may be shipped by regular transportation methods. </p><p></p><p>Note:  If the unaccompanied baggage shipment includes PBP&amp;E or required medical equipment, the PBP&amp;E and required medical equipment weight must be shown separately on the bill of lading. </p><p></p><p>051404.  Net Weight Determination</p><p></p><p>See Table 5-39 to determine the net weight of HHG and unaccompanied baggage.  The appropriate official (ordinarily the Transportation Officer) may deviate from these allowances on the rare occasion when, through no fault of the Service member, the shipment tare weight exceeds the allowances in Table 5-39.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 5-39.  Net Weight Determination</p><p>Method</p><p>Situation</p><p>Net Weight</p><p>1</p><p>Actual Weight</p><p>Weigh HHG and unaccompanied baggage before packing.</p><p>The HHG weight allowances are the actual weight of unpacked and uncrated HHG and unaccompanied baggage. </p><p>2</p><p>Government-Arranged Transportation</p><p>The Government arranges the move.

Government-Procured HHG Transportation</p><p></p><p>When the Government arranges HHG transportation through the Transportation Office, the Service member turns over the HHG to the Government, or the Government’s agent, for shipping.  The Government then assumes the responsibility for the HHG and for getting the HHG to the correct destination.  This shipping method is also called the GBL method, in reference to the Government Bill of Lading that the Government usually uses to pay for the HHG transportation. </p><p></p><p></p><p>051502.  Personally Procured HHG Transportation</p><p></p><p>A Service member or, in the event of a Service member’s death, the next of kin, can personally arrange HHG transportation and NTS. </p><p></p><p>A.  Responsibilities.  The Service member, or next of kin, when appropriate, who personally arranges for HHG transportation without going through a Government transportation office is responsible for all issues and costs related to any of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  The Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) if the transportation is to or from a location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The use of U.S. flag carriers, import and export processes, tariffs, customs, and if Service regulations require their use, any available Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers.</p><p></p><p>3.  HHG transportation costs paid by a third party.  The Service member or next of kin is not reimbursed for costs paid by a third party.</p><p></p><p>B.  Government Transportation Office not Available.  When the Service member personally arranges HHG transportation or NTS because either a Transportation Office is not available or a Transportation Officer instructs the Service member in writing to arrange transportation or storage at personal expense, reimbursement is authorized as follows:  </p><p></p><p>1.  The actual cost of shipment up to the maximum allowable weight allowance, not including special routing and services in par. 051306-E.</p><p></p><p>2.  The cost of a direct hire or rental cost of transportation, with or without an operator, not including special routing and services in par. 051306-E.</p><p></p><p>C.  Government-Procured Transportation is Available but not Used.  When Government-procured HHG transportation and NTS is available, but the Service member or next of kin, when appropriate, chooses to personally arrange transportation, there are two reimbursement methods.  </p><p></p><p>1.  Actual Expense Method</p><p></p><p>a.  The actual expense method is when the actual cost of the shipment is reimbursed.  Reimbursement is limited to the Government’s constructed “Best Value” cost for the actual HHG weight transported, up to the Service member’s maximum authorized HHG weight allowance.  </p><p></p><p>b.  SIT and any small package service arrangements are also reimbursed at the actual cost incurred, limited to the Government’s constructed cost for the weight of items stored or transported.  </p><p></p><p>2.  Monetary Allowance Method.  The second method is the monetary allowance method, also referred to as the personally procured move (PPM).  Under this method, the Service member or next of kin, as appropriate, receives payment of a monetary allowance equal to 95% of the Government’s constructed “Best Value” cost for the actual HHG weight transported up to the Service member’s maximum authorized weight allowance.  Regardless of the actual cost of the HHG shipment, a Service member receives 95% of the “Best Value”.  If the actual cost of the HHG shipment is less than or equal to 95% of the Government’s “Best Value”, the Service member is authorized payment of 95% of the “Best Value”.  See the Internal Revenue Service’s rules on the potential tax impact if the 95% payment is more than the actual expenses incurred.  If the Service member’s actual costs are more than the 95% that this method allows, the reimbursement may be made under the Actual Expense Method.</p><p></p><p>D.  Determining Weight.  The weight of HHG transported is normally established with certified weight certificates from a public weigh master or Government scales.  The public weigh master is the person who issues the weight certificates.  The net weight, or the Service member’s authorized weight allowance, whichever is less, is used to determine the Government’s constructed cost.  </p><p></p><p>1.  Using a constructed weight of 7 pounds per cubic foot may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process when weight certificates are not available due to one of the following reasons:</p><p></p><p>a.  A public scale or Government scale was not available.</p><p></p><p>b.  The HHG was moved commercially and the carrier or contractor was paid for the move on a basis other than weight.  </p><p></p><p>2.  When the carrier or contractor constructs the weight, the carrier or contractor may be requested to substantiate the reasonableness of the constructed weight.  If the constructed weight is unreasonable, the Service may base reimbursement on a reasonable weight. </p><p></p><p>E.  Government’s Constructed Cost (GCC).  The Armed Forces and NOAA use different factors in computing the GCC for HHG transportation than does the USPHS.  </p><p></p><p>1.  For the Armed Forces and NOAA, the GCC is determined by using the “Best Value” methodology for the channel and the actual HHG weight up to the Service member’s authorized maximum HHG weight as follows:  </p><p></p><p>a.  For shipments within the CONUS, between the CONUS and Alaska, and within Alaska (called domestic shipments), the GCC includes the following “Best Value” charges:  </p><p></p><p>(1)  Line haul, packing, and unpacking.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Line haul factor charges at the origin and destination.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Short-haul charges for shipments moving 800 or fewer miles.  </p><p></p><p>b.  For international shipments, which include shipments to or from Hawaii and to or from U.S. territories and possessions, the GCC includes the “Best Value” “Surface” Single Factor Rate (SFR).  </p><p></p><p>c.  Payment of accessorial charges may only be authorized or approved when charges would have been authorized during a Government-arranged move and all applicable tariff approval rules have been met.  For details on how “Best Value” costs are determined, see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value).  </p><p></p><p>d.  For the USPHS, the GCC:  </p><p></p><p>(1)  In the CONUS is determined by using the lowest applicable tariff rate plus the applicable packing allowance rate, and then multiplying that sum by the actual HHG weight, which is limited to the Service member’s authorized maximum HHG weight.  The USPHS may select an alternate method when appropriate.  </p><p></p><p>(2)  To, from, or between locations OCONUS is constructed using the Single Factor Rate or other method selected by USPHS.  </p><p></p><p>F.  Final Settlement.  Final settlement for reimbursement of personally procured transportation, regardless of the transportation method, is based on the GCC of the actual weight moved, limited to the authorized PCS weight allowance.  Submit certified weight certificates or an acceptable constructed HHG weight with the claim for reimbursement.  The Government cannot incur moving expenses for HHG that is more than 100% of the Government’s projected cost to transport the HHG commercially.  </p><p></p><p>051503.  Split Shipments  </p><p></p><p>A Service member may ship HHG by Government-procured and personally procured transportation.  The combined HHG shipments is limited to the Service member’s authorized HHG weight allowance and the Government’s “Best Value” cost to transport the authorized maximum PCS weight allowance in one lot between authorized places.  See section 0521 when HHG split shipment is necessary in connection with moving a mobile home.</p><p></p><p>051504.  HHG Improperly Transported or Misdirected</p><p></p><p>HHG that is improperly transported or otherwise unavoidably misdirected through no fault of the Service member may be transported at Government expense to the proper destination.  This includes HHG transported:  </p><p></p><p>A.  When a Service member is officially reported as dead, injured, ill, or absent for 30 or more days in a missing status, or upon death. </p><p></p><p>B.  In connection with the early return of dependents. </p><p></p><p>C.  Under one of the conditions in section 0520.</p><p></p><p>0516  TRANSPORTATION OF ITEMS OF EXTRAORDINARY VALUE </p><p></p><p>These items may be transported by an expedited mode that provides satisfactory service at the “Best Value” cost to the Government and cannot be included in unaccompanied baggage.  The net weight of such shipments is included as part of the Service member’s authorized PCS maximum weight allowance.  Irreplaceable items, or those having extreme financial or sentimental value, are not given special security even though the Service member may purchase extra-value insurance.  Examples of items of extraordinary value are items of gold and other precious metals, jewels, valuable art, or rare and costly collections, and items of substantial value ordinarily worn or carried that are prone to being stolen, such as cameras and binoculars.</p><p></p><p>0517  HHG EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SHIPPING</p><p></p><p>A.  General.  In addition to the actual shipment of the HHG, certain expenses associated with the shipment are considered part of the HHG transportation cost.  Costs are allowed up to those associated with the actual weight shipped limited to the authorized weight limit for the Service member.  </p><p>B.  Reimbursable Services.  The Government will pay for, or reimburse for, the following services:</p><p>1.  Packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, drayage, and hauling, as necessary.</p><p></p><p>2.  Special technical servicing to prepare household items for safe transport and use at the destination.  This does not include connecting or disconnecting appliances.</p><p></p><p>3.  Use of special rigging and equipment, such as cranes for HHG other than boats, for heavy or delicate items and handling.</p><p></p><p>4.  Storage in transit (SIT) up to 90 days, as applicable.</p><p></p><p>0518  HHG STORAGE</p><p></p><p>SIT is included as part of HHG transportation unless specifically prohibited. .  NTS may be authorized or approved as an alternative to HHG transportation for any or all of a Service member’s HHG when storage is in the Government’s best interest. </p><p></p><p>A.  Storage in Transit (SIT).  SIT may be authorized or approved at any DoD-approved storage facility at the origin, the destination, or any point in between.  SIT cannot begin before the date the HHG is released to a transportation service provider or to the Government for transportation.  The time limit is cumulative and may accrue at any combination of the origin, the destination, or any point in between.  The Service member is financially responsible for SIT storage charges that accrue after the appropriate time limit expires if the HHG is not removed and additional time has not been authorized under this section.  </p><p></p><p>Note:  The actual SIT time-period restrictions must be enforced, regardless of commercial billing practices.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member on a PCS order is authorized 90 days of SIT for authorized HHG, unless specifically prohibited by this section.  </p><p></p><p>2.  When the HHG cannot be withdrawn during the first 90 days due to conditions beyond the Service member’s control, a Service member may request a time-limit extension.</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service-designated official may authorize or approve SIT for 90 or fewer additional days. </p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member must state in writing the reasons that additional SIT is required.  Additional SIT may be authorized or approved due to circumstances beyond the Service member’s control, such as: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Serious illness of the Service member.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Serious illness or death of a dependent.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Directed TDY after arrival at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Non-availability of suitable civilian housing or awaiting completion of a residence under construction.</p><p>(5)  Acts of God.</p><p></p><p>(6)  Impending assignment to Government quarters, Government-controlled quarters, or privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>3.  When the HHG in SIT at Government expense cannot be withdrawn within the first 180 days for circumstances beyond the Service member’s control, a Service-designated official may authorize or approve additional SIT upon request.  </p><p></p><p>a.  The Service-designated official may authorize or approve the request to extend the SIT beyond the first 180 days for a Service member who is on a TDY, or deployed for 90 or more days or for an indefinite period.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member may be authorized or approved SIT for more than the 180-day time limit through the Secretarial Process for reasons that the Service concerned deems appropriate and are beyond the Service member’s control.  The reason must result in his or her inability to take possession of the HHG within the 180-day time limit, such as when assignment to Government quarters or privatized housing is scheduled for a specific date after 180 days.  </p><p>       </p><p>(1)  Additional SIT may not be authorized or approved when a member elects to have a home built while other housing is available.  </p><p></p><p>(2)  Additional SIT must not be authorized or approved when a member elects to occupy private sector housing too small to accommodate all of the member&apos;s HHG.</p><p> </p><p>4.  A Service-designated official may authorize or approve one HHG partial lot withdrawal and delivery form SIT.  </p><p></p><p>a.  The official may authorize or approve a second HHG partial lot withdrawal and delivery when unforeseen circumstances that are beyond the Service member’s control arise after the first HHG withdrawal, and the Service member would experience hardship if the additional HHG withdrawal did not occur.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member is authorized additional partial lot withdrawals and deliveries of HHG from SIT.  However, any reimbursement is limited to the Government’s constructed cost to withdraw and deliver the HHG in one lot  (or two lots if the second partial lot withdrawal has been authorized or approved) from SIT.  The Service member must reimburse the Government for any excess costs incurred.</p><p></p><p>5.  When a Service member receives another PCS order after arrival at a new PDS, and the HHG is in SIT when he or she receives the order, SIT is authorized to continue until the new PCS order’s effective date, regardless of the time-limit restrictions in this section.  The allowances stated on the new PCS order determine any storage authorization after the effective date of the new PCS order. </p><p></p><p>6.  SIT may be authorized for a short-distance move between residences in a metropolitan area when the move is due to a PCS and both residences are not within the same PDS.  SIT in this situation must be specifically authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process (for DoD, not more junior than the gaining activity’s commander or ship’s commander who is an O-5 or above or civilian employee equivalent) that the Service member’s household relocation is mission essential, is in the Government’s best interest, and is not primarily for the Service member convenience.</p><p></p><p>7.  When a PCS order is amended or modified before the Service member arrives at the new PDS, but after the HHG is released for transportation or storage to a carrier, a contractor, or the Government, the type of storage authorized in the original PCS order continues until the amended or modified order’s effective date.  The allowances stated on the amended or modified order determine any subsequent storage after the effective date of the amendment or modification.  </p><p></p><p>8.  When a PCS order is canceled or revoked after the HHG is released for transportation or storage to a transportation service provider or to the Government, the Service member is authorized the storage type in the original PCS order until the cancellation or revocation date.  The Service member is authorized SIT in connection with transporting and delivering HHG to an authorized place.  </p><p></p><p>9.  The Service concerned may authorize or approve the conversion of a Service member’s HHG that is in NTS to SIT.</p><p></p><p>a.  A conversion of HHG from NTS to SIT may be at any combination of the following locations, unless otherwise prohibited in the JTR:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Origin.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The destination.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Any point in between in connection with the transportation from NTS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The conversion cost is at Government expense if the NTS is at Government expense.  The time limit for SIT begins on the day after the NTS authorization ends. </p><p></p><p>10.  The Service concerned may authorize or approve converting SIT to NTS when a Service member receives a new PCS order authorizing HHG transportation or NTS.  All or part of the SIT, as needed by the Service member, can become NTS at Government expense when authorized or approved.  The authorized period of NTS begins on the same day as the effective date of the PCS order that authorizes the NTS.  Unless otherwise stated in the JTR, transportation of HHG converted from SIT to NTS is not authorized until another PCS order is issued. </p><p></p><p>11.  SIT is not authorized for a PCS short-distance move within the PDS limits or for a non-PCS short-distance move, such as to and from Government quarters. </p><p></p><p>12.  SIT is not authorized for HHG transported for TDY, except:</p><p></p><p>a.  That HHG within the TDY weight allowance may be placed in SIT when on either of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  A PCS with TDY en route or deployment en route.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A TDY or a deployment for 90 or fewer days and the Service-designated official authorizes or approves SIT as necessary for reasons beyond the Service member’s control. </p><p></p><p>b.  For an RC member relieved from any of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Active duty from an initial active duty for training tour that is less than 6 months.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Active duty for a tour less than 20 weeks.</p><p>(3)  Active duty for training tour of 20 or more weeks when the active duty is performed at more than one location, but less than 20 weeks at any one location.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Non-Temporary Storage (NTS)</p><p></p><p>1.  NTS may be authorized or approved by the official designated by the Service concerned in facilities determined to provide the best value to the Government.  NTS includes necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, transportation to and from the storage locations, storage, and other directly related services necessary to place the HHG in the designated storage facility.</p><p></p><p>2.  NTS must be in a storage facility near the location of the HHG on the date the Service member’s PCS order is issued.  However, the official designated by the Service concerned may select a different storage facility based on the best value to the Government.  When HHG is returned to the CONUS from OCONUS for NTS, the official designated by the Service concerned determines the storage location.  When HHG that is en route under one order at the time another order is issued that authorizes NTS, the HHG may be placed in NTS upon arrival at the initial destination or diversion point. </p><p></p><p>3.  To determine the Government’s cost for NTS, subtract the weight of HHG transported under the same PCS order from the Service member’s maximum authorized HHG weight allowance .  The Government’s maximum obligation for NTS is limited to the cost of storing the weight remaining.  The storage cost for weight that exceeds the authorized weight allowance is the Service member’s financial responsibility. </p><p></p><p>4.  Once authorized or approved, NTS begins on the date the order is issued and continues as long as that order is in effect.  When one authorization for NTS ends and is immediately followed by a new authorization for NTS, the NTS continues uninterrupted.  Additionally, when HHG is in NTS when another order authorizing NTS is received, the NTS continues until the end of the latest order.  </p><p></p><p>5.  Each Service may specify circumstances for which NTS is authorized as an alternative to HHG transportation.  Otherwise, a Service member is authorized NTS as an alternative to HHG transportation only if authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  NTS must not be authorized as an alternative to HHG transportation when a dependent performs Early Return of Dependent (ERD) travel due to disciplinary action taken against the Service member.  </p><p></p><p>6.  A Service member may withdraw any or all of the HHG from NTS instead of continuing storage.  Withdrawn HHG must be used by the Service member or his or her dependent in their residence.  The withdrawal from NTS, a short-distance move, unpacking, and uncrating of the withdrawn HHG is at Government expense.  No additional transportation or storage of the withdrawn HHG is authorized before another PCS order is issued, except as specified in this section. </p><p></p><p>7.  A Service member is authorized NTS for HHG that cannot be accommodated when moving into or out of assigned Government quarters or assigned privatized housing in the CONUS, or assigned Government quarters OCONUS if specifically authorized in Service regulations.  The NTS is authorized for moves directed by appropriate authority due to a Service requirement.  </p><p></p><p>a.  Reasons the Service might require the Service member to move include use of idle facilities, to vacate the Government quarters or privatized housing because it is unfit for occupancy, or for an unusual Service operational requirement.</p><p></p><p>b.  NTS is also authorized when the Service member is reassigned to Government quarters or privatized housing once the reason requiring him or her to vacate the housing is resolved.</p><p>c.  For NTS in this situation, there is no weight allowance limitation.</p><p></p><p>d.  NTS costs include the packing, crating, transporting, unpacking, and uncrating necessary for the move.  The Government also pays the cost for handling out, delivery, and unpacking of HHG that is in NTS to the Service member’s local residence, when the  HHG was in NTS because they would not fit in the assigned Government quarters.</p><p></p><p>8.  NTS is authorized when an appropriate authority directs a Service member to vacate Government-controlled quarters in the CONUS or OCONUS because the quarters are unfit for occupancy or to meet an unusual Service operational requirement.  See section 0519 for the applicable time limits on NTS for local moves.  Government-paid costs include necessary packing, crating, unpacking, and uncrating of the HHG, with no weight limitations.  The Government also pays to transport the HHG to both of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Between the Government-controlled quarters and the NTS facility.</p><p></p><p>b.  From the NTS facility to quarters occupied in lieu of the vacated Government-controlled quarters. </p><p></p><p>9.  NTS is authorized with no weight limitations when either of the circumstances occurs:</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member is ordered to vacate local private-sector housing. </p><p></p><p>b.  A tour of duty at a PDS is involuntarily extended and the Service member is required for reasons beyond his or her control to change local private-sector residences.  NTS is authorized until the reporting date, or the report-not-later-than date, on the next PCS order.</p><p></p><p>10.  NTS is not authorized in the following situations:  </p><p></p><p>a.  When a Service member is assigned to Government quarters or privatized housing for his or her convenience or morale.</p><p></p><p>b.  When a Service member voluntarily vacates Government quarters or privatized housing for personal reasons or convenience.  The Government will not pay for either of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  NTS of the HHG moved from the Government quarters or privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>(2)  NTS of any HHG previously placed in NTS in excess of what could be accommodated in the Government quarters or privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>c.  When the early return of a dependent and HHG in par. 050804 causes the termination of Government quarters or privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>d.  When the advance return of a dependent and HHG in par. 052009-B and par. 052009-C causes the termination of Government quarters or privatized housing.</p><p></p><p>11.  A Service member on a PCS order to a remote area in the CONUS with a shortage of available housing may place HHG in NTS when authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p></p><p>12.  When a PCS order is amended or modified before the Service member arrives at the new PDS, but after the HHG is released for transportation or storage to a carrier, a contractor, or the Government, the type of storage authorized in the original PCS order continues until the amended or modified order’s effective date.  The allowances stated on the amended or modified order determine any subsequent storage after the effective date of the amendment or modification. </p><p></p><p>13.  A Service member who separates from the Service, or is relieved from active duty, and is authorized HHG transportation to the HOR or PLEAD under par. 051002, is authorized NTS.  NTS is authorized for 180 days after the active-duty termination date.  </p><p></p><p>a.  Upon expiration of the 180-day limit, the Service member may withdraw the HHG from NTS at the Government-authorized storage facility and continue storing the HHG at personal expense at a local commercial storage facility if within the old PDS area.  The Service member retains his or her HHG transportation allowance to the HOR or PLEAD at Government expense. </p><p> </p><p>b.  A Service member may submit a request through the Secretarial Process for an extension of the time limit to ship HHG.  When the extension is approved it does not apply to NTS time limits.  The following conditions must be included in the Service member’s request for the Secretarial Process consideration:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member is financially responsible for the cost of picking up and delivering the HHG to the local commercial storage facility.  He or she is also financially responsible for all excess costs associated with the HHG pick up from the commercial storage facility, such as assessorial charges, excess weight, pick-up, repacking, and inventory of the HHG items.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Any damage or loss associated with the relocation of the HHG from NTS to the commercial storage facility, and while stored at personal expense, is the Service member’s financial responsibility.  The Government is not liable for any damage or loss under the Personnel Claims Act.</p><p></p><p>(3)  The Service member certifies that he or she owned the HHG on the effective date of the separation order.</p><p></p><p>14.  A Service member (or a dependent in the event of a retired Service member’s death) who is authorized HHG transportation to a HOS is authorized NTS.  NTS ends 1 year from the date of active duty termination.  An extension of the 1-year time limit may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process if a Service member is undergoing hospitalization or medical treatment, or is recalled to active duty before selecting a home (see section 0510).  </p><p></p><p>15.  If the HHG weight in NTS plus the weight of the HHG transported on the same PCS order exceeds the Service member’s maximum authorized weight allowance, he or she may request that the Government pay the costs associated with the excess weight storage.  If the request is approved and the Government pays those costs, the excess storage costs are the Service member’s financial responsibility and he or she must reimburse the Service for the costs in accordance with the Service’s regulations. </p><p></p><p>C.  Delivery Out of Storage.  As long as the Service member’s order or transportation authorization is valid, the Government will pay for the delivery of HHG from storage, regardless of the amount of time the HHG was stored.  This includes HHG shipments converted to storage at the Service member’s expense. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>0519  LOCAL MOVES</p><p></p><p>Short-distance HHG moves within the Service member’s PCS weight allowance, unless otherwise specified in this section, may be authorized within the same city, town, or metropolitan area for the events in Table 5-40.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-40.

Short-Distance Move for a Reassignment or PCS </p><p></p><p>A.  Reassignment between Activities at the Same PDS or between PDSs Located in Proximity.  A short-distance move is authorized through the Secretarial Process when a household relocation is mission essential, is in the Government’s best interest, and is not primarily for the Service member’s convenience.  The Service member must commute daily from the new residence to his or her duty location for a short distance move to be authorized.  For DoD, the authorizing official must be the gaining activity or ship commander in a grade of O-5 or above, or a civilian employee at the equivalent grade. </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member is authorized a short distance move when reassigned between activities at the same PDS that is not a PCS.  The JTR does not require certification for a short-distance HHG move to, from, or between designated locations to which dependent travel is authorized when the Service member is ordered on a dependent-restricted tour or to unusually arduous sea duty.  Service regulations may require such certification.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is authorized a short-distance move for a PCS between PDSs located in proximity to each other.  PDSs are in proximity to each other if they meet one of the following criteria:  </p><p></p><p>a.  Both are in an area ordinarily serviced by the same local public transit system.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member could commute daily from home to either PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  PCS between PDSs not in Proximity.  A short-distance HHG move between two locations in proximity to each other is authorized when a Service member is on a PCS order between PDSs that are not in proximity to each other. </p><p></p><p>051902.  Separation or Retirement from the Service  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member separated from the Service or relieved from active duty in par. 051002, or a Service member who is retired, placed on the TDRL, discharged with severance pay, or involuntarily released to inactive duty with readjustment pay in par. 051003 may be authorized a short distance HHG move.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A short-distance HHG move is authorized between residences or from NTS to a residence within the same city, town, or metropolitan area.  The maximum authorized weight allowance  in  applies.  Such a move is the final HHG transportation authorized by par. 051002 and par. 051003.</p><p></p><p>051903.  Short-Distance Assignment or Termination</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member authorized to relocate to or from Government quarters, privatized housing, or Government-controlled quarters by an appropriate authority may be eligible for a short-distance HHG move, except for short-distance moves due to separation or relief from active duty under honorable conditions or retirement. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Neither the weight limitation in  nor the 18,000-pound limit imposed by 37 U.S.C. §476, applies to this paragraph.  </p><p></p><p>1.  Government Quarters or Privatized Housing.  A short-distance HHG move is authorized to or from Government quarters or privatized housing to the residence from which the Service member previously commuted, or will commute daily, to the PDS.  </p><p></p><p>a.  The move must be directed due to a Service requirement, such as:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Assignment to Government quarters or to privatized housing to live in housing that is unoccupied .</p><p></p><p>(2)  Vacating Government quarters or privatized housing because it is unfit to occupy, an unusual Service operational requirement, or due to an order to vacate.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Reassignment to the Government quarters or privatized housing when the conditions that required vacating the housing are corrected.</p><p></p><p>b.  A short-distance move may be made from or to a point more distant than the residence from which the Service member is to commute on a daily basis to the PDS provided the Service member accepts financial responsibility for all excess costs.</p><p></p><p>c.  A short-distance HHG move under this paragraph is not authorized  for a Service member’s convenience or morale, or to accommodate a Service member’s personal problem.</p><p></p><p>2.  Government-Controlled Quarters.  A short-distance HHG move is authorized when a Service member occupying quarters under a Service’s jurisdiction (other than Government quarters) is directed to vacate the quarters.  </p><p></p><p>a.  Reasons for requiring the move are because they are unfit for occupancy or to meet an unusual Service operational requirement.  The move is authorized from the Government-controlled quarters to another local residence from which the Service member is to commute daily to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  If vacating the quarters is temporary, the Service member is authorized a combination of allowances for a short-distance move and NTS to the temporary residence, and a return short-distance move from the temporary residence and NTS to the Government-controlled quarters.</p><p></p><p></p><p>051904.  Short-Distance Move When Vacating Local Private-Sector Housing </p><p></p><p>A.  Directed by Proper Authority to Vacate Local Private-Sector Housing.  A short-distance move is authorized from local private-sector housing to other local private-sector housing from which the Service member will commute daily to the PDS when ordered to vacate the private-sector housing for the Government’s convenience.</p><p></p><p>1.  There is no weight limit based on grade for this move.</p><p></p><p>2.  A short-distance move is not authorized when a Service member moves from local private-sector housing due to a landlord’s refusal to renew a lease or permit continued occupancy.  This move is considered to be for the Service member’s convenience.  However it may be authorized if it is due to a military necessity or requirement, such as an involuntary tour extension.</p><p></p><p>B.  Short Distance Move when Vacating Local Private-Sector Housing Due to Involuntary Tour Extension.  A short-distance HHG move is authorized when the tour of duty at a PDS is extended and the move is required for reasons beyond the Service member’s control.  There is no weight limit based on grade for this move.  The move is authorized from the residence from which the Service member commuted daily to the PDS to another residence, or from NTS to Government or private-sector housing.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Vacating Private-Sector Housing Due to Foreclosure.  An Armed Forces Service member, or his or her dependent, who relocates from leased or rented private housing due to a foreclosure action against the landlord is authorized a short-distance HHG move.  This provision does not apply when the Service member or his or her dependent is the homeowner.  The move is authorized to another residence from which the Service member will commute daily to the PDS, or to a location where the dependent resides.  The PCS HHG weight limit in  applies.  Before this authority is used, a Service member is encouraged to exhaust remedies available under the Service Member’s Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. §3951) and state law.  </p><p></p><p>0520  HHG TRANSPORTATION RELATED TO CATEGORIES OF TRAVEL</p><p></p><p>HHG transportation under this section must be supported by a travel order that identifies the specific paragraph number that authorizes the transportation.  </p><p></p><p>052001.

PCS HHG Transportation to, from, or between Locations OCONUS and to, from, or between Ships</p><p></p><p>When the HHG is transported to, from, or between locations OCONUS, the maximum HHG weight allowances and any weight or item restrictions relevant to the particular location apply.  Factors, such as tour length, scheduled months remaining on the tour when the HHG arrives, and whether a Service member has a command-sponsored dependent, impact the HHG transportation.</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG Transportation When Performing a PCS to a Location OCONUS or to a Ship</p><p></p><p>1.  Table 5-42 specifies the HHG transportation and allowances when performing a PCS to a PDS OCONUS under certain conditions.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-42.  Transportation of HHG to a PDS OCONUS</p><p>If a Service member…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>is ordered to a PDS OCONUS where transportation of HHG is permitted, </p><p>a.  the Service member is authorized HHG transportation from the last or any previous PDS to any combination of the following locations:</p><p>(1)  the new PDS.</p><p>(2)  a location in the CONUS specified by the Service member.</p><p>(3)  NTS.</p><p>b.  the total cost of HHG transportation to the new PDS and a location in the CONUS specified by the Service member is limited to what it would have cost the Government had the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance been shipped in one lot from the old PDS or other authorized location to the new PDS OCONUS.</p><p>2</p><p>is ordered to a PDS OCONUS and is advised, in writing, that HHG transportation will be authorized within 20 weeks after the Service member’s port reporting month (see also Item 4 for an accompanied tour), </p><p>the HHG that the Service member selects to go to the PDS OCONUS may be placed in NTS until transported to the PDS.  The remaining HHG may be:</p><p>a.  transported for the duration of the OCONUS assignment to a location in the CONUS specified by the Service member.</p><p>b.  placed in NTS.</p><p>3</p><p>must vacate Government quarters at the old PDS upon receipt of a PCS order as specified in Item 2 above and establishes a temporary residence for a dependent near the old PDS pending authority for the dependent’s movement to the new PDS, </p><p>the Service member may transport, at Government expense, the HHG the Service member needs to establish a temporary residence for the dependent to a place in the old PDS vicinity.  HHG not needed to establish the temporary residence may be shipped to a location in the CONUS specified by the Service member, or store them in NTS.  These HHG cannot be transported again at Government expense until the Service member’s next PCS.</p><p>4</p><p>is ordered to a PDS OCONUS on an accompanied tour, and is advised, in writing, that the HHG transportation will be authorized 20 or more weeks after the Service member’s port reporting month, </p><p>a.  the HHG that the Service member identifies for transportation to the PDS OCONUS may be placed in NTS until they are transported.  The remaining HHG may be transported to a location in the CONUS designated by the Service member or placed in NTS, where they will remain for the duration of the assignment OCONUS.  The remaining HHG may also be transported to a non-foreign location OCONUS, limited to the cost from the old PDS to the designated place, if the: </p><p>(1)  Service member was a legal resident before entering active duty.</p><p>(2)  Service member’s spouse was a legal resident at the time of the marriage.</p><p>(3)  Service member was called to active duty from that non-foreign location OCONUS. </p><p>(4)  non-foreign location OCONUS is the Service member’s HOR.</p><p>b.  when HHG transportation is later authorized from the designated place to the PDS OCONUS, HHG can be shipped if both of the following occur, the Service member has:</p><p>(1)  a command-sponsored dependent.</p><p>(2)  at least 12 months remaining on the tour OCONUS on the date the dependent is scheduled to arrive.</p><p>5</p><p>must vacate Government quarters at the old PDS upon receipt of the PCS order in Item 4 above and establishes a temporary residence for a dependent near the old PDS pending authority for the dependent’s movement to the new PDS, </p><p>the Service member may transport or store HHG not needed to establish the temporary residence as indicated in Item 4 above.  HHG needed to establish a temporary residence for a dependent to a place in the old PDS vicinity may be transported at Government expense.  When HHG transportation is later authorized to the new PDS, transportation is authorized from storage or the place last moved at Government expense to the new PDS.  Any HHG not transported to the new PDS may be transported or stored as indicated in Item 4 above.</p><p>6</p><p>is ordered from a PDS in the CONUS to a PDS OCONUS to which HHG transportation is prohibited or restricted:</p><p>a.  By Service regulations,</p><p>b.  Because the Service member is serving an unaccompanied tour,</p><p>c.  Because the Service member is serving a dependent-restricted tour,</p><p>d.  Under unusual circumstances, </p><p>HHG transportation is authorized to:</p><p>e.

When a Service member is ordered on a PCS that is an accompanied tour, and that tour is changed to a dependent-restricted tour, or sea duty is changed to unusually arduous sea duty, he or she is authorized transportation of HHG, depending on when the change in duty designation occurs.  When both NTS and HHG transportation are provided as options, a portion of the Service member’s HHG can be transported and the remainder placed in NTS.  Table 5-44 specifies allowances related to HHG transportation when a Service member’s duty designation changes. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 5-44.

An exception may be granted through the Secretarial Process when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of the 12 months at the PDS OCONUS.  If the Service member chooses to leave the HHG at the location they were transported to instead of shipping them to the PDS OCONUS when the tour type changes, that location is the authorized origin on a subsequent PCS.  </p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Transportation Between PDSs OCONUS, from OCONUS to a Ship, or Between Ships.

From NTS to the new home port.</p><p>e  NTS instead of transporting HHG to the new home port.</p><p></p><p>C.  Tour Extensions OCONUS.  A Service member on a tour of less than the specified PDS tour length, who used the HHG transportation authority when originally assigned to that PDS is authorized HHG transportation from the location of the HHG to the current PDS.  This is limited to the cost of moving HHG from the old PDS to the new PDS.  This transportation is limited to the situation in which the Service member’s tour is extended due to: </p><p></p><p>1.  Unusual circumstances and needs of the Service.</p><p></p><p>2.  Failure to transport all HHG to the PDS initially due to the anticipated short assignment time to that PDS (B-208861, November 10, 1982).</p><p></p><p>D.  HHG Transportation When Performing an In-Place Consecutive Overseas Tour (IPCOT).  An IPCOT is not a tour extension, but is new full tour that is served at the same PDS OCONUS.  A Service member stationed OCONUS who is selected to serve an IPCOT is authorized HHG transportation in Table 5-46.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-46.  HHG Transportation Due to IPCOT</p><p>Tour Change</p><p>Dependent Allowances</p><p>1</p><p>Unaccompanied to Accompanied</p><p>a.  HHG may be transported from a designated place to the current PDS, where the IPCOT will be served, if a dependent is command-sponsored at the current PDS.</p><p>b.  A Service member who gains a dependent after the PCS order’s effective date, but before starting an IPCOT, is authorized HHG transportation to the current PDS, where the IPCOT is to be served, if the dependent is command-sponsored at the current PDS.  HHG transportation in this case is from the HHG location to the current PDS.</p><p>c.  HHG acquired after a PCS order’s effective date, but before starting the IPCOT, may be shipped using this table as the authority. </p><p>2</p><p>Accompanied to Unaccompanied</p><p>a.  HHG may be transported to the same locations authorized for a dependent in par. 050806-D.</p><p>b.  A Service member who gains a dependent after a PCS order’s effective date, but before starting an IPCOT, is authorized HHG transportation to the same locations authorized for a dependent in par. 050806-D. </p><p>3</p><p>Accompanied to Accompanied</p><p>A Service member who gains a dependent after a PCS order’s effective date, but before starting an IPCOT, is authorized HHG transportation if the dependent is command-sponsored at the current PDS, where the IPCOT is to be served.  HHG transportation in this case is from the location of the HHG to the current PDS. </p><p>4</p><p>a.  The HHG weight shipped on the original PCS order is not deducted from the weight allowance authorized for the IPCOT move.</p><p>b.  This table authorizes HHG to be shipped when the HHG is acquired after a PCS order’s effective date, but before starting the IPCOT.  </p><p>c.  The applicable PCS HHG weight allowance applies to the PCS following the IPCOT.</p><p></p><p>E.  HHG Transportation When Performing a PCS from a Location OCONUS or Sea Duty</p><p></p><p>1.  When a Service member performs a PCS from either a location OCONUS or regular sea duty to a location in the CONUS or to a non-foreign location OCONUS where transportation of HHG is authorized, HHG may be transported from the place last shipped at Government expense to the new PDS.  Any weight allowance restrictions imposed by the Service for HHG shipment from the old PDS apply.  The total weight of HHG shipped plus HHG stored is limited to the Service member’s authorized PCS weight allowance.  The total cost of HHG transportation is limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport the HHG in one lot from the old PDS to the new PDS. </p><p>2.  A Service member on a PCS order from a ship, afloat staff, or afloat unit while the ship or unit is deployed away from the home port is authorized unaccompanied baggage transportation from the deployed unit without regard to distance. </p><p></p><p>3.  HHG may be transported from the place last shipped at Government expense to the new PDS, under one of the following circumstances, when a Service member:</p><p></p><p>a.  Was assigned to a PDS to which Service regulations prohibited or restricted HHG transportation.</p><p></p><p>b.  Served an unaccompanied tour or a dependent-restricted tour.</p><p></p><p>c.  Was assigned to a unit specified in writing through the Secretarial Process as unusually arduous sea duty (see par. 050907 for a Service member with dependents). </p><p></p><p>d.  Was assigned to a ship or afloat staff that had been classified as unusually arduous sea duty.</p><p></p><p>e.  Was assigned aboard a ship or afloat staff specified through the Secretarial Process as operating OCONUS for an expected continuous period of 1 or more years, and the 1-year period started on the date the ship or afloat staff was specified as operating OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>F.  Consumable Goods.  A Service member assigned to a PDS OCONUS listed at Consumable Goods Allowance is authorized transportation of consumable goods in addition to HHG.  The number of pounds of consumable goods authorized for shipment is at Consumable Goods Allowance, and is in addition to the authorized HHG weight allowance.  Consumable goods are transported using the same methods as HHG, with the same originating location.  An alternate shipping origin for consumable goods in unusual circumstances may be authorized through the Secretarial Process, as well as consumable goods transportation for tour extension or IPCOT at a PDS listed at Consumable Goods Allowance.  The consumable goods must be for the Service member’s or a dependent’s personal use.</p><p></p><p>052003.  HHG Transportation in Connection With a Unit Home Port Change </p><p></p><p>A.  Unit Home Port Change Officially Announced.  The home port change announcement is a PCS order modification until the PCS order is later amended, modified, canceled, or revoked. </p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A Service member who has delayed HHG transportation to the old home port or one who has been issued a PCS order to a unit and the PCS order lists the unit’s location as the old home port after the home port change has been announced may be eligible for HHG transportation.  </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances.  When an official announcement has been made designating a home port change, no further HHG transportation to the current home port (also called the old home port) can be made until a new order is issued.  However, if the HHG is in transit or in an otherwise irreversible transportation status on the date the home port change announcement is made, the HHG transportation to the old home port may continue.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Unit Home Port Officially Changed.  The provisions for a Service member in the last row of Table 5-27 do not apply to this subparagraph.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member assigned to a unit that is not specified as unusually arduous sea duty is authorized HHG transportation or NTS on the effective date of the home port change.  HHG transportation is authorized to the new home port from the old home port, a former PDS, a previously designated place, or from NTS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member assigned to a unit specified as unusually arduous sea duty (see par. 050907) is authorized HHG transportation to the destination authorized for dependents in section 0509 or to NTS on the home port change effective date.</p><p></p><p>3.  A Service member is not authorized HHG transportation to the new home port when both of the following apply.  The Service member receives a PCS order: </p><p></p><p>a.  Directing detachment from the unit whose home port is being changed.</p><p></p><p>b.  Before HHG is transported to the new home port.</p><p></p><p>052004.  HHG Transportation in Connection with an Alert Notice </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member whose unit has been officially alerted for movement to a dependent-restricted PDS OCONUS within 90 days after the alert notice is issued may be eligible for HHG transportation.  This also applies to a Service member who is transferred or assigned to the unit after it was alerted. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  HHG transportation and NTS are authorized as though the Service member is assigned to a dependent-restricted tour in Table 5-42, item 8.</p><p></p><p>2.  When the HHG has been transported or stored under this paragraph, but the Service member is not transferred to the PDS OCONUS intended  in the alert notice, HHG transportation is authorized from the location last transported at Government expense to the Service member’s PDS.  This also applies to returning HHG to that PDS if the Service member continues on permanent duty at the location where the alert notice was officially announced.  </p><p></p><p>052005.  HHG Transportation Related to the Early Return of a Dependent </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  When a Service member’s dependent is at a PDS OCONUS, circumstances may result in the dependent returning to the CONUS before the Service member’s next PCS.  When a dependent is transported due to these reasons, HHG transportation may also be authorized as specified in this paragraph.  These circumstances are separated into three groups:</p><p></p><p>1.  Departure due to official situations. </p><p></p><p>2.  Reasons of national interest. </p><p></p><p>3.  Departure due to personal situations. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Authority for HHG transportation for a dependent and a former family member under this paragraph is in addition to, and has no effect on, the authority for HHG transportation based on dependency status and grade on the Service member’s next PCS order effective date.  The Service member is authorized to transport up to the full HHG weight allowance under the next PCS order.  See PDT computation example 12.</p><p></p><p>1.  HHG Transportation from a Foreign or Non-Foreign Location OCONUS Due to Official Situations</p><p></p><p>a.  When a dependent is transported to a designated place from a foreign or non-foreign location OCONUS for one of the official reasons in par. 050804, the order may also authorize HHG transportation.  The HHG weight is limited to the authorized PCS weight allowance or an administrative weight limitation related to the foreign or non-foreign location OCONUS.  The HHG may be transported from any location, including from NTS, to the designated place. </p><p></p><p>b.  If the official reason that caused the departure of the dependent is resolved or changed so that the dependent can return to the PDS OCONUS, and the AO determines that the return is in the Government’s best interest, the order authorizing the dependent return can also authorize HHG transportation.  The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining in the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS; although, the Secretarial Process may grant an exception when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of those 12 months. </p><p></p><p>2.  HHG Transportation from a Location OCONUS Due to Reasons of National Interest.  When the Secretary concerned or a more senior official determines that a dependent must return from a location OCONUS for reasons of national interest before the Service member’s next PCS, the travel order authorizing the dependent transportation to a designated place may also authorize HHG transportation.  If the dependent is foreign-born, the travel order may also authorize him or her to travel to a destination in the dependent’s native country.  This applies whether the HHG is OCONUS or in NTS.</p><p></p><p>a.  Transportation of the HHG is authorized from any location, including NTS, to the designated place, or the dependent’s native country if that is where the dependent was relocated at Government expense. </p><p></p><p>b.  If national interests dictated that a dependent not be at the PDS, then the same travel order that authorizes the dependent’s transportation to the PDS OCONUS when the determining authority decides that national interest no longer requires the dependent to stay away from the PDS may authorize HHG transportation from the location where the Government relocated the dependent.  The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining in the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS; although, the Secretarial Process may grant an exception when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of those 12 months.  </p><p></p><p>3.  HHG Transportation from a Location OCONUS due to a Personal Situation .  An order authorizing dependent transportation under certain circumstances due to a personal situation may also authorize HHG transportation within the authorized PCS weight allowance or within the administrative weight limitation that may apply.  When authorized, HHG can be transported from any location, including NTS, to a designated place or, when granted through the Secretarial Process, to a destination in the dependent’s native country if the dependent spouse is foreign born.  Instead of shipping HHG, the Service member is also authorized NTS or continued NTS.  HHG transportation due to personal situations must be authorized in advance of the shipment unless otherwise specified in this paragraph.  </p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member with a dependent, on a PCS order to a new PDS OCONUS, who transports HHG to the PDS in anticipation of the dependent moving to the PDS OCONUS, may be provided return transportation for HHG if, for reasons beyond the Service member’s control, the dependent does not join the Service member.  The return transportation of the HHG may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process when in the best interest of the Service member or dependent and the Government.  The cost of shipping the HHG is limited to the transportation cost from the PDS OCONUS to the dependent’s location. </p><p></p><p>b.  A dependent who traveled without an order to an appropriate destination due to a personal situation may be authorized HHG transportation if an order is later issued approving dependent transportation and confirming HHG transportation.  The confirmatory order must be supported by the Service member’s commanding officer’s determination that all of the following conditions apply:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The dependent traveled to an appropriate location to live.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The dependent travel meets the conditions for traveling due to a personal situation, except that a travel order for transportation was not issued.</p><p></p><p>(3)  The dependent status as command-sponsored remains unchanged.  This does not apply for a Service member’s former dependent whose transportation could have been authorized under par. 050805.</p><p></p><p>(4)  It is in the Government’s best interest to issue an order approving dependent transportation to an appropriate destination for traveling due to a personal situation.  </p><p></p><p>c.  When a dependent who is authorized to reside in a location OCONUS dies, the Service member is authorized NTS of HHG that is at that location OCONUS, limited to the PCS weight limitation.  The NTS ends on the next specific reporting date or the Service member’s reporting-not-later-than date on the next PCS order to the CONUS.  </p><p></p><p>d.  When a former family member is authorized transportation related to a divorce or annulment, the travel order may also authorize HHG transportation under the same conditions and circumstances, and using the same terminal points, as in par. 050805 for the personal travel. </p><p></p><p>(1)  HHG transportation in this situation must be turned over to a Transportation Officer or to a carrier for transportation within 1 year after the final decree of divorce or annulment effective date, or within 6 months after the date the Service member completes personal travel from the PDS OCONUS due to a PCS, whichever occurs first. </p><p></p><p>(2)  An extension of the 6-month time limit may be authorized or approved for dependent travel in par. 050805.  If the 6-month time limit is extended, the HHG must be turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier for transportation within 1 year after the final decree of divorce or annulment effective date or the date the Service member completes personal travel due to a PCS, whichever occurs first. </p><p></p><p>e.  When an order authorizes dependent transportation under par. 052009-B, HHG transportation may be authorized.  The official authorizing the transportation determines the destination to which transportation is authorized and ensures that a reasonable relationship exists between the destination and the conditions and circumstances.  The cost is limited to what the Government’s cost would have been to transport the HHG between authorized locations.  The authorized locations for the origin are the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS, or the place to which the HHG was last transported at Government expense.  The authorized destinations are the Service member’s HOR, PLEAD, or the dependent’s designated place.  An additional authorized destination may be the foreign-born dependent’s native country when granted through the Secretarial Process.  NTS is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>(1)  When dependent transportation is authorized due to a Service member being convicted of a court martial and placed on leave while awaiting appellate review, then HHG transportation is limited to the cost from the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS to the HOR or PLEAD. </p><p>(2)  If HHG is transported under this paragraph, and the Service member returns to duty at a new PDS after being released from confinement, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation from the location where the HHG is located to the new PDS.  The cost of HHG transportation is limited to the cost from the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD to the new PDS.  The weight is based on the grade the Service member held on the PCS order’s effective date to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  If HHG is not transported under this paragraph, and the Service member returns to duty at a new PDS after being released from confinement, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation from the location where the HHG was last transported at Government expense to the new PDS.  The HHG weight is based on the grade held on the PCS order’s effective date to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>f.  When a custody agreement changes, or other legal arrangements change and the Service member is authorized dependent travel to return to the same or another PDS OCONUS under par. 050805, return transportation for HHG may be authorized through the Secretarial Process.  The transportation is limited to the cost from the place where the HHG was previously transported at Government expense to the PDS OCONUS.  The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining on the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS.  Exceptions may be granted through the Secretarial Process when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of the 12 months at the PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>g.  When a dependent leaves the PDS OCONUS before the Service member on an Early Return of Dependent order and the Service member subsequently serves an IPCOT:</p><p></p><p>(1)  HHG transportation is authorized to the IPCOT location under one of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>(a)  A dependent is returned to the PDS OCONUS at Government expense under par. 050804, </p><p></p><p>(b)   A dependent is returned at personal expense, and then is later command-sponsored</p><p></p><p>(2)  The cost of HHG transportation is limited to the cost from the place where the HHG was previously transported at Government expense to the PDS OCONUS.  The Service member must have 12 or more months remaining on the tour at the PDS OCONUS on the day the HHG is scheduled to arrive at that PDS.  Exceptions may be granted through the Secretarial Process when the HHG shipping time uses a portion of the 12 months at the PDS OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>052006.  HHG Transportation and Storage When Ordered on a PCS to a PDS in the Vicinity of Storage  </p><p></p><p>A.  Authorization.  A Service member is authorized NTS when ordered on a PCS to a PDS that is at or in the vicinity of a place where the Service member already has HHG in NTS.  HHG transportation from NTS to the residence is also authorized.  A Service member must take delivery of his or her HHG within the first 90 days.</p><p></p><p>B.  Extensions.  Due to conditions beyond the Service member’s control, if the HHG cannot be withdrawn from NTS during the first 90 days, then an additional 90 days of NTS may be authorized or approved as in section 0518-A.  An additional period of NTS beyond 180 days may be authorized or approved as in section 0518-A.  </p><p></p><p>052007.  PCS with TDY en Route, PCS While on TDY, or PCS Following TDY Pending Further Assignment  </p><p></p><p>A.  PCS with a TDY En Route or While on a TDY</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A Service member on a PCS order with a TDY en route, or on a PCS order without return to the old PDS while on a TDY, is authorized HHG transportation to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member may choose to transport HHG up to the TDY weight allowance to the TDY location for personal use, or may choose to put the HHG in NTS for the TDY’s duration.  The Service member retains the TDY HHG transportation allowance, regardless of the provisions of section 0205.  The Service member’s commanding officer, the AO, the destination Transportation Officer, or any other Service-designated official at the TDY location may authorize SIT for any portion of the TDY HHG at the TDY location.  When the TDY is completed, the TDY HHG, including those in SIT at the TDY location, may be transported to the new locations authorized in the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>b.  HHG placed in NTS may remain in NTS, when authorized in the PCS order, or it may be transported to the new PDS.  The total weight of the HHG transported plus the weight of HHG stored is limited to the Service member’s authorized PCS weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>B.  PCS Following TDY Pending Further Assignment</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A Service member whose HHG was placed in NTS at Government expense when the Service member was ordered to a TDY pending further assignment is eligible for HHG transportation or storage.</p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>a.  An eligible Service member is authorized NTS for the full TDY period.  An additional 90 days of NTS may be authorized or approved under the same provisions as those for SIT in section 0518 in one of the following circumstances: </p><p></p><p>(1)  The new PDS is OCONUS or at a location to which HHG transportation is prohibited or restricted.</p><p></p><p>(2)  For reasons beyond the Service member’s control, the HHG cannot be withdrawn within 90 days following TDY completion or during the first 90 days after the arrival date at either the PDS OCONUS or PDS where HHG transportation is prohibited or restricted.</p><p></p><p>b.  HHG transportation from storage to the residence is authorized under Table 5-35 when the new assignment is to one of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Sea duty.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Duty OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Duty at a PDS to which HHG transportation is prohibited and the designated place under par. 050907 is at or in the NTS location vicinity.</p><p></p><p>052008.  HHG in Connection with a Course of Instruction of 20 or More Weeks at Any One Location  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is on active duty, or ordered to active duty, to attend a course of instruction where the scheduled cumulative duration at one location is 20 or more weeks is authorized HHG transportation.  This includes courses taught at schools, military installations, and Foreign Service schools. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  HHG transportation may be authorized from the last, or any previous PDS or place of storage, or from the HOR or PLEAD, to the place where the course is conducted.  </p><p></p><p>2.  Upon approval by the Service concerned, all or part of the HHG already in NTS at the origin location may be converted to SIT at the Service member’s request if the travel order authorizes HHG transportation or NTS.  The NTS is converted to SIT at Government expense.  Once the storage is converted from NTS to SIT, any storage costs accruing after the 180th day are the Service member’s financial responsibility.  Unless additional SIT days are authorized under section 0518-A, no additional HHG storage is authorized until the next PCS order is issued.  </p><p></p><p>3.  If a Service member is permanently assigned when the course is completed to the location where the course was conducted, HHG transportation is authorized from NTS to the PDS.  Any HHG not placed in storage in connection with a tour extension may be transported to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member who is called or ordered to active duty for a course of instruction under this paragraph is authorized transportation of HHG from NTS to the HOR or PLEAD upon release from active duty, or to the new PDS if retained on active duty upon course completion. </p><p></p><p>052009.  HHG Transportation When a PCS is in Connection with Disciplinary Action</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG Transportation when a Service Member is Reduced in Grade</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is reduced in grade after HHG has been transported on a PCS order to a PDS, is authorized HHG transportation upon receipt of a PCS order from that PDS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances.  A Service member is authorized HHG transportation of the weight allowance for the grade held at the time of the PCS from that PDS, or when ordered to that PDS, whichever is greater.  When the Service member is serving in a grade lower than that held when ordered to the PDS, the PCS order from that PDS must cite this paragraph as authority and state the weight allowance for the Service member’s former grade.  The transportation origins and destinations continue to be the same as they were before the reduction in grade.  NTS authority continues regardless of the reduction in grade until the Service member’s next PCS order’s effective date.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Transportation Located in the CONUS when Disciplinary Action Is Taken Against a Service Member Stationed OCONUS.  Generally, HHG may be transported from any location and from NTS to a designated place.  HHG may be transported to a destination in the dependent’s native country if the dependent is foreign-born.  The Service member is also authorized NTS or continued NTS.  However, certain limitations exist as specified below.  An order may be issued providing HHG transportation before the Service member’s PCS if authorized or approved under par. 052005. </p><p></p><p>1.  An order may be issued for HHG transportation before the Service member’s PCS if authorized or approved when disciplinary action is taken against a Service member who is stationed OCONUS, discharged under other than honorable conditions, or sentenced to confinement with or without discharge as follows:</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member whose PDS is OCONUS who is not provided HHG transportation from the PDS OCONUS because the Service member has no dependents, or the dependents traveled at personal expense without an order, or other similar reason may be eligible for HHG transportation as indicated in Table 5-47.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-47.  Circumstances Allowing HHG Transportation when Disciplinary Action is Taken</p><p>If the Service member is…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>serving OCONUS and is dropped from the rolls, sentenced to prison, or transferred as a prisoner to a place of detention,* </p><p>a.  the officer exercising special or general court-martial jurisdiction over the Service member may authorize or approve HHG transportation when it is in the Government’s best interest.</p><p>b.  HHG transportation is limited to the authorized weight allowance of the grade held at the time the HHG is transported or when ordered to duty OCONUS, whichever is greater.</p><p>c.  the AO must determine the destination to which transportation is authorized and must ensure that a reasonable relationship exists between that destination and the conditions and circumstances. </p><p>2</p><p>serving OCONUS and is transferred to a different ship or location to await trial by court-martial as a Deserter or Straggler,* </p><p></p><p>3</p><p>sentenced by a court-martial to be confined or to receive a punitive discharge, including a bad conduct discharge, dishonorable discharge, or dismissal,* </p><p></p><p>4</p><p>sentenced to confinement in a foreign or U.S. civil confinement facility,* </p><p></p><p>5</p><p>returned to the CONUS for discharge under other than honorable conditions,* </p><p></p><p>6</p><p>returned to the CONUS to serve a sentence of confinement in civil or military confinement facilities,* </p><p></p><p>7</p><p>discharged OCONUS under other than honorable conditions,* </p><p></p><p>8</p><p>discharged under other than honorable conditions after surrendering to military authorities in the CONUS following a period of absence without leave from the PDS OCONUS,* </p><p></p><p>9</p><p>convicted by a court-martial and placed on leave involuntarily while awaiting completion of appellate review,** </p><p></p><p> *If the Service member has dependents, HHG transportation may be authorized limited to the Government’s cost from the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS or the place to which the HHG is last transported at Government expense, as applicable, to the Service member‘s HOR, PLEAD, or the designated place.  If the dependent is foreign-born, HHG transportation may be authorized to the destination in the dependent’s native country where the dependent is residing or will reside.  If the Service member has no dependents, HHG transportation is authorized from the Service member‘s PDS OCONUS to any location, limited to the cost from the PDS OCONUS to the Service member‘s HOR or PLEAD, as the Service member selects.</p><p>**The Government’s cost for HHG transportation, whether the Service member has dependents or not, is limited to the cost of transportation from the Service member’s last or former PDS OCONUS to the HOR or PLEAD, as the Service member selects.  When HHG is transported under this provision, it is the final separation of HHG transportation unless the Service member is restored to duty. </p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member whose HHG was transported while he or she was awaiting completion of appellate review of a court-martial conviction and then is later restored to duty following the appellate review.  HHG transportation is authorized from the location where HHG was transported when the Service member was placed on appellate leave to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>c.  A Service member separated from the Service.  NTS of HHG is not authorized as an alternative to transporting HHG or if the HHG is moved from Government or Government-controlled quarters.  </p><p></p><p>2.  When the Service member is released from confinement and returns to duty at a new PDS:</p><p></p><p>a.  If the HHG was transported at Government expense under one of the conditions in Table 5-47, the HHG may be transported from any location to the new PDS, limited to the cost from the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD to the new PDS.  The Service member’s PCS weight allowance is based on the grade held on the new PCS order’s effective date.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If the HHG was not transported at Government expense under one of the conditions in Table 5-47, HHG transportation is authorized from the location where the HHG was last transported at Government expense to the Service member’s new PDS.  The Service member’s PCS weight allowance is based on the grade held on the new PCS order’s effective date.  </p><p></p><p>C.  HHG Transportation Due to a Court-Martial Sentence or Administrative Discharge Under Other than Honorable Conditions for a Service Member with a Dependent Stationed in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility.  A Service member with a dependent who is stationed in the CONUS may be eligible for HHG transportation.  HHG transportation may be requested by the Service member, the Service member’s spouse, or another dependent if the Service member has no spouse or the spouse is not available.  The HHG transportation is directly related to dependent transportation under par. 051005 when the Service member is sentenced by a court-martial to any of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Confinement for more than 30 days.</p><p></p><p>b.  Receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge.</p><p></p><p>c.  Dismissal from a Uniformed Service.</p><p></p><p>d.  Receive an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances.  A Service-designated authority determines the authorized destination of the HHG and ensures that a reasonable relationship exists between that destination and the conditions and circumstances on a case-by-case basis.  The HHG transportation must be to a designated place.  A foreign-born dependent may have HHG transported to a destination in his or her native country.  The HHG must be turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier within 180 days from the date the court-martial is completed or the date the Service member is given an administrative discharge.  Additional time to turn over the HHG to the Transportation Officer or carrier may be granted through the Secretarial Process in par. 051002.  NTS is not authorized when HHG is moved out of Government or Government-controlled quarters or privatized housing, or as an alternative to transportation when the dependent is returned from OCONUS (see Table 5-47).  </p><p>3.  HHG transportation reimbursement may be paid to the Service member, or a dependent or ex-spouse when the Service member authorizes payment to either of those individuals. </p><p></p><p>052010.  HHG Transportation Due to Medical Travel or the Death of a Service Member</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member Ordered to a Hospital in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  When a Service member on active duty is ordered to a hospital in the CONUS from either a PDS or another hospital in the CONUS, HHG transportation may be authorized.  The receiving hospital’s commanding officer must issue a statement that the Service member’s case has been evaluated and the observation period or treatment in that hospital is expected to be prolonged. </p><p></p><p>a.  If the receiving hospital’s commanding officer does not issue a statement regarding prolonged hospitalization, the Service member is authorized transportation of unaccompanied baggage, limited to 225 pounds gross weight.  If the unaccompanied baggage is improperly transported or is unavoidably separated from the Service member, the unaccompanied baggage should be forwarded to the correct hospital’s destination.  The improperly transported unaccompanied baggage may be transported by an expedited mode when the origin’s commanding officer determines circumstances require the expedited mode.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If the receiving hospital’s commanding officer issues the prolonged hospitalization statement, the HHG transportation is the same as that authorized for a PCS.  The HHG transportation cost is limited to the cost to the hospital from any combination of:  the last or any previous PDS, the place where the HHG was last transported at Government expense, or the place of storage.  As an alternative to transporting HHG, the Service member may choose to place all or part of the HHG in NTS.  Additionally, any HHG already in storage when the Service member is hospitalized may stay in storage. </p><p></p><p>2.  When a Service member on active duty OCONUS transfers to a hospital in the CONUS for observation or treatment, the HHG may be transported from any authorized place to the hospital.  All or part of the HHG may be transported and placed in NTS.  Any HHG in storage when the Service member is hospitalized may stay in storage.  For the initial movement involving return from OCONUS to the hospital in the CONUS, the receiving hospital’s commanding officer’s statement that observation or treatment is expected to be prolonged is not required.  </p><p></p><p>3.  When a Service member is transferred to a hospital in the CONUS, he or she is authorized HHG transportation to any place in the CONUS instead of to the hospital, limited to the cost of transporting the HHG to the hospital.  When the HHG is transported from OCONUS, the cost is limited from the port through which transportation was made to the hospital.  If the HHG is transported overland from Canada or Mexico, the cost is limited to the cost of HHG transportation by the carrier and route ordinarily used for similar shipments from the origin to the hospital in the CONUS.  </p><p></p><p>4.  Release from Observation or Treatment</p><p></p><p>a.  HHG transportation is authorized when a Service member is released from observation or treatment and is any of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Restored to duty.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Separated from the Service.</p><p>(3)  Relieved from active duty.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Placed on the TDRL.</p><p></p><p>(5)  Retired, including transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.  </p><p></p><p>b.  HHG transportation is authorized from any combination of the last or any prior PDS or place where HHG was last transported at Government expense to a destination otherwise authorized in this part.  HHG previously transported due to hospitalization can be moved from the place last transported at Government expense to the authorized destination, limited to the cost from the hospital to the authorized destination. </p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Transportation When a Cadet or Midshipman Dies While Enrolled in a Service Academy.  The personal items belonging to a cadet or midshipman who dies while enrolled in a Service academy may be transported at Government expense to the home of the person legally authorized to receive the items.  </p><p></p><p>C.  HHG Transportation When a Service Member is Officially Reported as Injured or Ill, Absent for 30 or More Days in a Missing Status, or Upon Death.  For a Service member who died after retirement or release from active duty, see Table 5-55.  Table 5-48 specifies the HHG transportation for a Service member under one of the following statuses: </p><p></p><p>1.  An active-duty Service member who is officially reported as dead, injured or ill, or absent for a period of 30 or more days in a missing status in 37 U.S.C. §484.</p><p></p><p>2.  An active-duty Service member who dies while entitled to basic pay in 37 U.S.C. §476(f).</p><p></p><p>5-48.  HHG Transportation when a Service Member is Officially Reported as Injured or Ill, Absent for 30 or More Days in a Missing Status, or Upon Death</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>official notice is received that a Service member is dead,</p><p>HHG transportation is authorized to any of the following:</p><p>a.  A Service member’s HOR.</p><p>b.  A dependent’s residence, including the residence of a Service member’s spouse in the case of a Service member married to another Service member.</p><p>c.  Next of kin.</p><p>d.  Other person authorized to receive custody of the HHG. </p><p>2</p><p>official notice is received that a Service member is injured or ill and the anticipated period of hospitalization or treatment is expected to be for a prolonged duration as shown by a statement by the receiving hospital’s commanding officer,</p><p>3</p><p>official notice is received that a Service member is absent for a period of 30 or more days in a missing status,</p><p>4</p><p>an injured or ill Service member, or his or her dependent, next of kin, or another person authorized to receive custody of the HHG requests special routing and service, </p><p>Section 0513 of this chapter authorizes special routing and service.</p><p>5</p><p>a dependent resides OCONUS when a Service member on permanent duty OCONUS dies, </p><p>the HHG OCONUS may be transported to NTS, or part of the HHG may be transported to the interim location where the dependent will reside, pending the dependent’s decision on the destination of the final HHG move.</p><p>6</p><p>the dependent requests HHG transportation to a final destination,</p><p>the HHG transported to an interim location may later be transported to the final destination within the limitations in this paragraph. </p><p>7</p><p>a dependent takes physical possession of the HHG at an interim location, </p><p>the dependent is financially responsible for all costs in excess of the transportation cost of the 18,000-pound maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot from the origin OCONUS to the final destination via the interim location.  In determining excess costs, the cost of authorized SIT while the HHG is in transit is part of the cost of one lot from the origin to final destination. </p><p>8</p><p>the dependent’s final destination is at the interim location to which the HHG will be transported, </p><p>the HHG in NTS, at a designated place, or at a specific location may be transported to the interim location at Government expense for the dependent’s use.</p><p>9</p><p>an official notice is received that the Service member has died after the HHG has been transported,</p><p>the HHG transported under par. 052010-C3a may again be moved. </p><p>10</p><p>an official notice is received that the Service member’s status has changed from one status to another,</p><p></p><p>11</p><p>it is determined through the Secretarial Process that circumstances justify an additional move after the Service member has been officially reported as absent in a missing status for a period of more than 1 year,</p><p>the HHG may again be moved.*  </p><p>*If a mobile home was previously moved under Chapter 5, Part D, HHG may be transported under this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>3.  Limitations</p><p></p><p>a.  HHG transportation may be authorized or approved only if a reasonable relationship exists between the requested transportation destination and the circumstances of the Service member, the dependent, the next of kin, or another person authorized to receive custody of the HHG.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The authorized PCS HHG weight allowance limits do not apply to the HHG transported under this paragraph.  However, the Service member’s HHG weight allowance is subject to the 18,000 pounds net-weight limitation imposed by 37 U.S.C. §476(b)(1)(D). </p><p></p><p>c.  HHG transportation authority terminates if HHG is not turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier for transportation within the time limits in Table 5-49.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-49.  Time Limits</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>HHG is not turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier for transportation within 1 year from the date of the official status report, </p><p>the transportation authority ends 1 year after the date of the official status report.</p><p>2</p><p>HHG is not turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier for transportation within 1 year after the Service member dies while entitled to basic pay, </p><p>the transportation authority ends 1 year after the Service member’s death.</p><p>3</p><p>HHG is not turned over to a Transportation Officer or carrier within the 1year limit,</p><p>transportation at a later date may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process (see section 0510).  </p><p>4</p><p>the decedent’s estate becomes the subject of litigation during the authorized 1year period,</p><p>HHG may be transported within 1 year from the final court decree date. .</p><p>5</p><p>an active duty Service member entitled to basic pay died on or after January 6, 2006,</p><p>the Secretary concerned must give the dependent at least 3 years, beginning on the date of the Service member’s death, to choose an HOS for travel and transportation allowances. </p><p>6</p><p>a retiree died on or after January 6, 2006, and had not chosen an HOS at that time, </p><p>the dependent, or the retiree’s executor if there are no dependents, have 3 years from the Service member’s retirement date (when the Service member first accrued the right to select a home) to choose an HOS for travel and transportation purposes. </p><p></p><p>4.  When the identity of the person authorized to receive the Service member’s HHG is not known, is subject to litigation, or is known but has not yet been located and notified to take custody of the HHG, the HHG may be stored or kept in storage until a proper disposition can be made. </p><p></p><p>a.  SIT of HHG turned over to transportation within the time limits in Table 5-49 may be authorized or approved.  However, SIT of more than 180 days is the financial responsibility of the Service member, the dependent, the next of kin, or whomever is authorized to receive custody of the HHG. </p><p></p><p>b.  NTS of HHG belonging to a Service member is authorized when he or she is officially reported as absent for a period of 30 or more days in a missing status, is declared dead while in a missing status, or dies while entitled to basic pay and his or her dependent requests NTS. </p><p></p><p>(1)  When a missing status is officially terminated and the Service member returns to active duty, HHG may stay in NTS at Government expense until the Service member’s specific reporting date or the reporting-not-later-than date and the next PCS order.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If the Service member does not return to active duty, the transportation authority of the HHG placed in NTS is determined under section 0510, or provisions in par. 052010-C upon death of a Service member, as applicable.  </p><p></p><p>5.  If an active-duty Service member is married to another Service member, the spouse may transport the deceased, injured, ill, or absent Service member’s HHG in connection with the spouse’s next immediate PCS under the circumstances authorized in par. 052010-C.  Transportation of HHG in this situation replaces any other transportation authorized in par. 052010-C.  The 1-year time limit and the requirement for additional time in Table 5-49 do not apply.  For transportation purposes, the Service member’s and surviving spouse’s HHG may be combined.  The total weight is limited to 18,000 pounds plus the HHG weight allowance of the surviving spouse.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>052011.  HHG Transportation When a Service Member is Ordered from a PDS to Await an Order, Detail, Assignment, or Separation  </p><p></p><p>A.  Ordered from a PDS in the CONUS.  A Service member who is ordered from a PDS in the CONUS may place his or her HHG into NTS.  Upon receipt of an order assigning the new PDS, HHG transportation from NTS is authorized from storage or the previous PDS to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Ordered from a PDS OCONUS.  When a Service member is ordered to the CONUS from a PDS OCONUS, HHG transportation may be authorized from the PDS to the place in the CONUS where he or she is ordered to report even if it is not the new PDS, which is unknown.  If an order to the new PDS is not available when the HHG arrives, the HHG may be placed in NTS.  Upon receipt of the order naming the new PDS, the same HHG may be transported to that PDS.  In these circumstances, the order that detaches the Service member from the PDS OCONUS and the order naming the new PDS are one PCS order.  If the Service member takes physical possession of the HHG, the Government must not further transport the HHG because that is considered to be for the Service member’s convenience.  Table 5-50 specifies HHG transportation allowances for a Service member ordered from a PDS OCONUS to the United States or to a non-foreign area OCONUS for separation processing when he or she is authorized to select an HOS. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-50.  Ordered from a PDS OCONUS to the United States or </p><p>to a Non-foreign Area OCONUS for Separation Processing with HOS Authorized</p><p>If the Service member…</p><p>Then the HHG…</p><p>1</p><p>is ordered from a PDS OCONUS to an area in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS for separation processing with HOS authorized under par. 051003,</p><p>may be placed in NTS or may be transported from the PDS to the place to which ordered to report.  Once the HOS is selected, this HHG may be later transported under par. 051003.  </p><p>2</p><p>takes possession of the HHG at the processing station,</p><p>transportation to the HOS from the processing station is still authorized.  The Service member must agree to bear all costs in excess of transporting the maximum authorized PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot directly from the PDS OCONUS to the HOS via the processing location.  The costs of delivering, unpacking, re-packing, and re-shipping of the HHG to the Service member at the processing location are not part of the Government’s cost obligation (44 Comp. Gen. 826 (1965)).  In determining excess costs, the cost of the authorized SIT is part of the cost of one lot from origin to final destination.  </p><p>3</p><p>has a HOS at the same location as the processing station,</p><p>in NTS at a designated place or location during the tour OCONUS may be transported to the processing station. </p><p></p><p>Note: A NOAA Marine and Aviation Operations and Commissioned Personnel Center is a processing station for NOAA.  </p><p></p><p>052012.  HHG Transportation Due to Separation from the Service or Relief from Active Duty </p><p></p><p>A.  HHG Transportation and NTS - General</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member on active duty who is separated from the Service or relieved from active duty under par. 051002, is authorized HHG transportation, limited to the authorized PCS weight allowance, to the HOR or PLEAD, whichever the Service member selects. </p><p></p><p>a.  HHG transportation is authorized from the last or any previous PDS, a designated place, or an authorized storage location.  The Service member may transport the HHG between any locations other than those authorized.  Any excess costs are the Service member’s financial responsibility.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If the Service member transports his or her HHG between locations other than those authorized, the Transportation Officer or Finance Office computes the excess costs based on either the cost that the Government would have incurred for transporting the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot from the last PDS or the cost of transporting the HHG from its actual location, whichever would result in a lower cost to the Government. </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member who is authorized HHG transportation under par. 051002 is authorized NTS.  The authority begins on the date the order is issued and terminates on the end of the 180th day from the active-duty termination date.  </p><p></p><p>3.  SIT of the HHG transported from NTS under par. 051002 is authorized only when necessary due to conditions beyond the Service member’s control  that arise after HHG transportation from NTS and the SIT is authorized or approved according to Service regulations.  Any HHG not placed in NTS may be placed in SIT under section 0518-A,  in connection with transportation under par. 051002.  </p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Transportation and NTS - Other Circumstances</p><p></p><p>1.  Table 5-51 specifies circumstances affecting the allowance for separation from the Service and release from active duty and the associated allowances.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-51.  Separation or Relief from Active Duty under Certain Circumstances</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>Service member is separated or relieved from active duty to continue on active duty in a Uniformed Service,</p><p>HHG transportation or NTS is authorized only if the Service member is transferred on a PCS order in connection with his or her continuance or reentry into a Service.  </p><p>2</p><p>a Service member is separated or relieved from active duty because his or her enlistment or term of service expires and, on the following day, re-enters the Service at the location where he or she was separated or relieved with no change of PDS, </p><p>neither HHG transportation nor NTS is authorized. </p><p>3</p><p>a Service member serving in the CONUS has no dependents and is separated from the Service under other than honorable conditions, </p><p></p><p>4</p><p>an RC member is ordered to:</p><p>a.  Initial active duty for training for 6 or fewer months,</p><p>b.  Active duty, including active duty for training, for less than 20 weeks,</p><p>c.  Active duty for training for 20 or more weeks when the active duty is performed at more than one location, but less than 20 weeks at any location,</p><p>HHG transportation, including SIT for 30 or fewer days, is authorized upon relief from such duty.  The weight allowance authorized is the TDY HHG weight allowance, not the PCS weight allowance.  HHG transportation is authorized from the last duty location or place where the HHG was last transported at Government expense to the HOR or PLEAD or active duty for training location.  NTS is not authorized. </p><p>5</p><p>a Service member is separated to pursue an undergraduate degree through the ROTC scholarship program, </p><p>HHG transportation to that college, the HOR, or PLEAD, as the Service member chooses, is authorized.  Transportation is authorized from the last or any previous PDS, a designated place, or an authorized storage location.  If the Service member chooses HHG transportation between other places, he or she is financially responsible for all costs in excess of those that would have been incurred had the HHG been transported between authorized locations.  Storage is authorized in section 0518.  </p><p>6</p><p>a Service member is separating from the Service or is being released from active duty and:</p><p>a.  is authorized HHG transportation, </p><p>b.  is required by appropriate authority to vacate Government quarters, Government-controlled quarters, or privatized housing before actual separation or release from active duty,</p><p>a short-distance move of HHG up to the Service member’s authorized PCS weight limit is authorized from the vacated quarters or privatized housing to a local temporary residence in the vacated quarters or privatized housing vicinity. </p><p>7</p><p>a Service member actually separates or is released from active duty after moving from vacated quarters or privatized housing to a local temporary residence, under the circumstances in item 6 of this table,</p><p>HHG transportation within the time limits and within the Service member’s weight allowance is authorized from the local temporary residence to the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD, whichever the Service member selects.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member awaiting the results of physical disability proceedings is authorized HHG transportation to the home or specific location where he or she is awaiting those results.  If separated or relieved from active duty, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation to an authorized point.  The cost of HHG transportation is limited to the cost of transporting the HHG from the Service member’s PDS when he or she received the order to proceed in an awaiting-orders status to the point authorized due to separation or relief from active duty, less any amount previously paid for HHG transportation to the point where he or she awaited the results.  To be authorized HHG transportation, the Service member must:</p><p></p><p>a.  be found unfit to perform the duties of his or her grade by a physical evaluation board.</p><p></p><p>b.  not be authorized an HOS move under par. 051003.</p><p></p><p>c.  have been ordered home or to a specific location to await the results of the disability proceedings for the Government’s convenience.  </p><p></p><p>d.  sign a written release agreeing not to contest the initial physical evaluation board results.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Time Limit.  Authority for HHG transportation is limited to 180 days.  Such authority ends on the 181st day following separation from the Service or relief from active duty, unless a written request for HHG transportation is submitted to a Transportation Officer or designated representative before the end of the 180th day.  </p><p>1.  When an HHG transportation application is made within 180 days, HHG must be turned over for transportation as soon as practicable after the submission.  The Transportation Officer or designated representative determines the reasonableness on a case-by-case basis. </p><p></p><p>2.  A time limit extension for HHG transportation does not extend the Government’s obligation for storage costs for a period greater than what was authorized or approved under par. 051002 for NTS or section 0518 for SIT.  Following NTS expiration, the HHG must be transported as soon as possible to the final destination.  </p><p></p><p>3.  In hardship cases, a time-limit extension may be authorized or approved for a specific period of time through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Service Member Recalled to Active Duty after Separation from the Service or Relief from Active Duty.  A Service member who is recalled to active duty after being separated from the Service or relieved from active duty, and who was previously authorized HHG transportation and NTS, may be authorized either HHG transportation or NTS under the recall order. </p><p></p><p>1.  If the Service member has his or her HHG in NTS when recalled to active duty, the HHG is authorized to remain in NTS if the Service member is otherwise authorized NTS.  The authorization is valid from the active-duty recall date until the date he or she is again separated from the Service or relieved from active duty.  </p><p></p><p>a.  If the Service member is ordered on a TDY due to a recall, continued storage may be provided only if he or she qualifies for special storage under Chapter 2. </p><p></p><p>b.  If the Service member is ordered on a PCS due to the recall, continued NTS under the PCS order may be authorized and provided to the Service member.  </p><p></p><p>2.  If the Service member had HHG in NTS when recalled to active duty, and he or she is again separated from the Service or relieved from active duty under honorable conditions, the Service member is authorized NTS under par. 051002 and HHG transportation to the HOR or PLEAD, whichever location the Service member selects.  The HHG must be turned over to a carrier for transportation within 180 days after the date the Service member is separated or released from active duty following a recall. </p><p></p><p>052013.  HHG Transportation in Connection with Retirement, Placement on the TDRL, Discharge with Severance or Separation Pay, or Involuntary Release from Active Duty with Readjustment or Separation Pay</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG Transportation and Storage -- General</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member on active duty is authorized HHG transportation from the last or any previous PDS; from a designated place in the CONUS, from a designated place in a non-foreign area OCONUS, or from anywhere the Service member selects, subject to par. 051306; from storage; or any combination of these locations to the Service member’s HOS when the Service member is:  </p><p></p><p>a.  Retired for physical disability or placed on the TDRL, regardless of length of service.</p><p></p><p>b.  Retired with pay for any other reason, including transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, immediately following 8 or more years of continuous active duty with no single break in service of 91 or more days.</p><p>c.  Separated with severance or separation pay immediately following 8 or more years of continuous active duty with no single break in service of 91 or more days.</p><p></p><p>d.  Involuntarily released from active duty with readjustment or separation pay immediately following 8 or more years of continuous active duty with no single break in service of 91 or more days.</p><p></p><p>2.  HHG transportation is authorized to a place other than the Service member’s HOS, or for a split shipment that sends part of the HHG to the HOS and part to some other place, provided the Service member bears all costs in excess of transportation of his or her maximum PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot to the HOS, HOR, or PLEAD, whichever provides the greatest cost savings to the Government.  </p><p></p><p>3.  Transportation to the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD under par. 052012, but not to a HOS, is authorized when a Service member:</p><p></p><p>a.  Is retired without pay.</p><p></p><p>b.  Has less than 8 years of continuous active duty immediately preceding retirement for any reason other than physical disability.</p><p></p><p>c.  Has less than 8 years of continuous active duty immediately preceding discharge with severance or separation pay, or is involuntarily released to inactive duty with readjustment or separation pay.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-52.

This time period may be extended through the Secretarial Process.  There is no authority to extend NTS beyond the 1 year active-duty termination.  </p><p>4</p><p>begins education or training to qualify for transition into civilian employment during the 1-year period following the active-duty service termination date, or during a longer period authorized due to hospitalization or medical treatment,</p><p></p><p></p><p>C.  Other Deserving Cases</p><p></p><p>1.  Time limit extensions may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process when:</p><p>a.  An unexpected event beyond the Service member’s control occurs that prevents him or her from moving to the HOS within the specified time limit.</p><p></p><p>b.  The extension is in the Service’s best interest or to the Service member’s benefit, and it is not more costly or adverse to the Service.  This includes cases where the 1-year time limit has already been extended due to hospitalization, medical treatment, education, or training.</p><p></p><p>2.  Time limit extensions may be authorized or approved only for the specific period of time the Service member anticipates is needed to complete the move.  If, at the expiration of this extension period, additional time is required, the Service member may request an additional extension through the Secretarial Process, explaining the reasons for the extension.  An additional authorized period for a specific time may then be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  Time-limit extensions are not authorized for any reason for more than 6 years from the date of separation, release from active duty, or retirement.  Also see par. 051003-I for restrictions on time limit extensions.</p><p></p><p>3.  Delays in HHG transportation under this subparagraph must be due to the Service member’s separation from the Service.</p><p></p><p>4.  Extensions for HHG transportation do not change the Government’s obligation for storage costs for longer than a 1-year period from the active duty termination date, except when a longer period is authorized for hospitalization or medical treatment.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Service Member Required to Vacate Government or Government Controlled Quarters or Privatized Housing before Selecting a Home.  When a proper authority requires a Service member to vacate Government or Government-controlled quarters, or privatized housing, before choosing an HOS, the Service member is authorized HHG transportation for a short-distance move from the vacated quarters or housing to a local temporary residence in the vacated housing vicinity.  The Service member’s PCS weight allowance applies for this short-distance move.  HHG transportation is authorized within the specified time limits and for the Service member’s PCS weight allowance from the local temporary residence to the HOS.  </p><p></p><p>E.  Recall to Active Duty.  When a Service member is eligible to select a home under par. 051003, and is recalled to active duty, certain HHG transportation allowances are authorized.  Table 5-54 identifies the situations and allowances when such a recall occurs. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-54.  Recall to Active Duty</p><p>If a Service member</p><p>is recalled to active duty…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>before selecting a home, and has HHG in NTS under Table 5-52,</p><p>NTS may continue from the date the Service member is recalled to active duty until he or she reverts to a retired status, provided he or she is otherwise authorized NTS storage. </p><p>2</p><p>before selecting a home and ordered on a TDY due to the recall,</p><p>continued NTS storage may be provided only if the Service member qualifies for special storage under par. 032903 and section 0205. </p><p>3</p><p>before selecting a home and ordered on a PCS due to the recall,</p><p>NTS may continue if authorized on the PCS order. </p><p>4</p><p>before selecting a home and had his or her HHG in NTS at the time of recall, </p><p>when the Service member reverts to a retired status under honorable conditions, NTS and HHG transportation to an HOS are authorized.  The HHG must be turned over to a carrier for transportation within 1 year after the date the Service member is released from active duty following the recall and reversion to the retired status. </p><p>5</p><p>after selecting and traveling to a HOS,</p><p>HHG transportation is authorized to the previous HOS or PLEAD, whichever the Service member chooses for travel allowances, upon termination of active duty under honorable conditions. </p><p></p><p>F.  Service Member on the TDRL Who is Discharged or Retired.  When a Service member on the TDRL is discharged with severance pay or retired for any reason, including transfer to the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve, HHG transportation is not authorized.  However, the Service member may be eligible for HHG transportation to the HOS, storage, or have his or her time-limit extensions granted due to hospitalization, medical treatment, education, training, or other deserving cases in this section. </p><p></p><p>G.  Service Member Ordered Home to Await Disability Retirement.  A Service member is authorized HHG transportation when a physical evaluation board finds that he or she is unfit to perform the duties of his or her grade and the Service member is ordered home or to a specific location for the Government’s convenience to await another order in connection with disability retirement.  HHG transportation is authorized to the home or a specific location.  HHG transported under this paragraph may be re-transported when a retirement or other order is finally issued.  However, the maximum HHG authorization is for the distance from the Service member’s PDS at the time he or she received the order to proceed in an awaiting-orders status, to the point to which the Service member is authorized due to retirement or release from active duty, less any amount previously paid for transportation of the HHG to the waiting point. </p><p></p><p>H.  Service Member Dies after Retirement or Release from Active Duty.  If a Service member, authorized HHG transportation to a HOS under par. 051003-A and par. 051003-B, dies after retirement or release from active duty, certain HHG transportation allowances are authorized.  Table 5-55 specifies the conditions and allowances associated with this event.  The time limits in par. 051003-I apply to HHG transportation under this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-55.  HHG Transportation when a Service Member</p><p>Dies after Retirement or Release from Active Duty</p><p>If a Service member dies…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>after choosing a HOS in par. 051003 but before transporting HHG, </p><p>the HHG may be transported, at a dependent’s request, to the Service member’s HOS, other dependent selected place, or partially to each location.  The dependent is financially responsible for all costs in excess of the transportation cost in one lot to the Service member’s chosen HOS.  If there are no surviving dependents, the HHG may be transported to the home of the person legally authorized to receive them.  That person is financially responsible for all costs in excess of the transportation of the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance to the Service member’s chosen HOS. </p><p>2</p><p>after choosing a HOS and traveling to that HOS but before HHG transportation,</p><p>3</p><p>after choosing a home but has not traveled to the HOS, has not executed any travel allowance associated with the HOS, or transported his or her HHG,</p><p>the HHG may be transported at Government expense, at a dependent’s request, to the Service member’s HOS or the dependent-selected home that would have been authorized under par. 051003-B or partially to each location.  The dependent is financially responsible for all cost in excess of the transportation of the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance in one lot to the dependent-selected home.  If there are no surviving dependents, the HHG may be transported to the home of the person legally authorized to receive them. </p><p>4</p><p>choosing a HOS under par. 051003,</p><p></p><p></p><p>052014.  HHG Transportation for a Dependent Relocating for Personal Safety</p><p></p><p>See par. 051205.</p><p></p><p>0521  HHG AND MOBILE HOME ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>When a Service member chooses to move a mobile home, ordinarily, HHG transportation is not authorized.  The mobile home shipment is instead of the HHG shipment.  However, there are a few instances when HHG transportation may be authorized when a mobile home is also being shipped.  </p><p></p><p>052101.  Transportation of HHG Removed from a Mobile Home to Meet Safety Requirements</p><p></p><p>The HHG that must be removed from a mobile home to meet safety requirements may be transported at Government expense.  Determine the cost limit on mobile home transportation under Chapter 5, Part D by deducting the cost of transporting the removed HHG from the total Government-constructed cost to transport the Service member’s maximum authorized HHG PCS weight allowance.  The remaining amount is the cost limit.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>052102.  HHG Transportation Authorized When a Mobile Home is Also Transported</p><p></p><p>A.  PCS between a PDS in the CONUS to Alaska, a PDS in the CONUS to OCONUS, a PDS in Alaska to Alaska, or a PDS in Alaska to OCONUS.  See PDT computation example 15.</p><p></p><p>1.  When concurrent dependent travel is authorized or is to be authorized within 20 weeks from the Service member’s port reporting month, but not all of the dependents can travel to the new PDS OCONUS, a Service member is authorized both of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Unaccompanied baggage and other HHG transportation to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>b.  Mobile home allowances to a designated place in the CONUS or Alaska if the dependents who are not traveling to the PDS are to use the mobile home as a residence during the Service member’s tour OCONUS under one of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>(1)  When a Service member married to a Service member can combine their PCS weight allowances to a new PDS and each of them is authorized to move a mobile home on a PCS order.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A dependent travels to or from a designated place or selected point in the CONUS or Alaska to a new PDS that is neither in CONUS nor Alaska.</p><p></p><p>2.  If a Service member is assigned to duty OCONUS and concurrent travel of a dependent is denied or is delayed for an anticipated period of 20 or more weeks from a Service member’s port reporting month, then the Service member may choose mobile home allowances to a designated place in the CONUS or Alaska.  If the Service member chooses to move a mobile home to a designated place, then the Service member is authorized unaccompanied baggage and other HHG transportation to the PDS OCONUS, subject to the following limitations: </p><p></p><p>a.  The Government’s total liability for the cost of moving the mobile home, shipping the unaccompanied baggage and other HHG is limited to the total Government-constructed cost to transport the Service member’s maximum authorized PCS HHG weight allowance between the old PDS and new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If the dependent is later authorized to travel to the PDS OCONUS at Government expense, the Service member may transport the HHG from the designated place to the PDS OCONUS.  The Government’s cost liability for the HHG transportation allowance for moving the mobile home, any unaccompanied baggage and HHG already shipped to the PDS OCONUS, plus any HHG shipped from the designated place to the PDS OCONUS is limited to what it would have cost the Government to ship the Service member’s maximum authorized PCS HHG weight allowance between the old PDS and new PDS.  </p><p>3.  A Service member stationed OCONUS or outside Alaska who is returned to the CONUS or Alaska under a PCS order and who chooses mobile home allowances within the CONUS or Alaska, is also authorized HHG and unaccompanied baggage transportation from the PDS OCONUS or Alaska to the new PDS, HOR, PLEAD, or HOS, as applicable.  The Government’s cost liability for the total of the mobile home move,  the shipment of HHG, and the unaccompanied baggage transportation is limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport the Service member’s authorized maximum PCS HHG weight allowance between the old PDS and new PDS, HOR or PLEAD, or HOS, as applicable</p><p></p><p>4.  A Service member who chooses mobile home allowances between a PDS in Alaska and a PDS in the CONUS is not authorized HHG or unaccompanied baggage transportation, unless the HHG was removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Unusual or Emergency Circumstances</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member who is stationed in Alaska or OCONUS is authorized his or her HHG and unaccompanied baggage from the PDS to a designated place, but not for the HHG removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements, when both of the following occur:</p><p></p><p>a.  A dependent is returned to the CONUS or Alaska under the rules for an early return of the dependent or under section 0508 or section 0512.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member chooses mobile home allowances within or between the CONUS or Alaska under the rules for an early return of a dependent.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member is not authorized HHG or unaccompanied baggage transportation, but is authorized transportation of the HHG removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements when both of the following occur:</p><p></p><p>a.  A dependent is returned from Alaska to the CONUS due to a personal situation OCONUS, including travel in the CONUS when disciplinary action is taken against a Service member who is stationed OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member chooses mobile home allowances from Alaska to the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>C.  Mobile Home Delivery not Completed.  When mobile home delivery at the authorized destination is prevented by circumstances beyond the Service member’s control, HHG transportation is authorized as specified below.</p><p></p><p>1.  When the HHG has been turned over to the Government to transport, and the Government-procured transportation is unable to deliver the mobile home to the destination, compute the HHG transportation cost in Table 5-56.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-56.  Computation when Government-Procured </p><p>Transportation is Unable to Complete Delivery</p><p>1</p><p>Determine what would have been payable to transport the mobile home to the destination.</p><p>2</p><p>Add the cost to transport any HHG removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements.</p><p>3</p><p>Add any unaccompanied baggage and other HHG transported.</p><p>4</p><p>Subtract any cost to the Government for mobile home transportation to the location where the Government-procured transportation is unable to deliver the mobile home, also known as the breakdown point.</p><p>5</p><p>The remainder is the allowable cost to ship the HHG.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a Service member personally arranges for HHG transportation, and the personally-procured commercial transportation is unable to complete the delivery of a mobile home to the destination, HHG transportation is authorized limited to: </p><p></p><p>a.  What would have been payable if the mobile home had been transported by Government-procured transportation to the authorized destination, less any TDY HHG weight allowance transported, SIT, and dry storage that was provided for the mobile home transportation to the point of breakdown. </p><p></p><p>b.  The Government’s total cost is limited to the cost to transport the PCS weight allowance of HHG from the old PDS to the new PDS not to exceed the GCC. </p><p></p><p>D.  HHG Removed from a Mobile Home to Meet Safety Requirements.  The HHG that must be removed from a mobile home to meet safety requirements may be transported at Government expense.  HHG transportation cost must be deducted from the total cost of what it would have cost the Government to transport the Service member’s maximum authorized HHG weight to determine the Service member’s cost limit on mobile home transportation under Chapter 5, Part D.  </p><p></p><p>052103.  HHG Transportation Not Authorized</p><p></p><p>HHG transportation is not authorized for a Service member who chooses mobile home allowances except:  </p><p></p><p>A.  Those HHG transportation allowances specified in this section.</p><p></p><p>B.  For a Service member married to a Service member (see Chapter 5, Part D).</p><p></p><p>C.  When a mobile home is transported in connection with an alert notice. </p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART D:  MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION (SERVICE MEMBERS)</p><p></p><p>0522  INTRODUCTION</p><p></p><p>This Part identifies mobile home transportation allowances for a Service member ordered on a permanent change of station (PCS).  A mobile home may be moved by commercial or Government means between the old permanent duty station (PDS) and new PDS, when the PDSs are located within specific geographic boundaries, or to or from authorized selected points when one of the PDSs is at a location outside the continental United States (OCONUS) other than in Alaska.  A selected point is a location within the continental United States (CONUS) or Alaska where the mobile home is kept while a Service member, with or without dependents, is at a PDS OCONUS other than Alaska.  Transportation in this Part includes packing, pickup, line-haul or drayage, delivery, and unpacking. </p><p></p><p>0523  STANDARD ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>052301.  Transporting a Mobile Home Instead of Household Goods (HHG) </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member on a PCS order may be authorized mobile home transportation allowances instead of household goods (HHG) transportation at Government expense when traveling to a new PDS that is either in the CONUS or Alaska.  The Service member either has no dependent or has a dependent who travels to the new PDS at the same time as the Service member.  A dependent may also be eligible for mobile home allowances when he or she is authorized to travel to or from the designated place or selected point in the CONUS or Alaska to a new PDS OCONUS.  A mobile home eligible for transportation must meet all of the following conditions: </p><p></p><p>1.  The mobile home is acquired on or before the PCS order’s effective date to use as a residence by the Service member or a dependent at the location where it is being moved. </p><p></p><p>2.  The mobile home’s condition is maintained (including body, chassis, tires, and tubes) to withstand the transportation rigors.  Any necessary maintenance to prepare the mobile home for transportation is at either the Service member’s, dependent’s, or heir’s expense and to the Government’s satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>Table 5-57.  Dependent Travel that Affects PCS Allowances for Moving a Mobile Home</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>two Service members are married to each other and both have PCS orders,</p><p>they may combine their authorized PCS HHG weight allowances.  Determine the maximum amount the Government may pay is equal to the GCC of shipping the combined maximum authorized HHG weight allowances for both members between authorized locations.. </p><p>2</p><p>a Service member is married to a civilian employee and both have PCS orders,</p><p>they may combine their PCS HHG weight allowances. </p><p>3</p><p>a dependent is authorized to travel to or from the designated place or selected point in the CONUS or Alaska to a new PDS OCONUS,</p><p>a.  the Service member is authorized mobile home transportation and shipment of the HHG removed from the mobile home to the border crossing or appropriate port or designated place or selected point (see par. 052101). </p><p>b.  The Service member may transport unaccompanied baggage and HHG, which includes the cost of packing, pickup, line-haul or drayage, delivery and unpacking to the new PDS.  </p><p>c.  The Government’s maximum liability to transport the mobile home, any HHG removed from the mobile home, and any unaccompanied baggage or HHG transported to the new PDS for the Service member’s use, limited to the Government’s cost to transport the HHG at the Service member’s PCS weight allowance from the old PDS to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>C.  “Best Value” Transportation.  The “Best Value” Transportation methodology is used to determine the maximum cost authorization for Armed Forces and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the channel times and for the maximum HHG weight for grade and dependency status.  The constructed mobile home transportation is always the “Best Value” transportation cost of the Service member’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance between the authorized points.  For details on how “Best Value” costs are determined, see the DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value). </p><p></p><p>Note:  U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) computes the Government’s cost to transport the Service member’s maximum PCS weight allowance by using the method USPHS would have selected to transport the Service member’s HHG.</p><p></p><p>D.  Constructed Government Cost.  The constructed Government cost to transport the Service member’s mobile home, plus any HHG removed from the mobile home, and any unaccompanied baggage or HHG transported is limited to the Governments “Best Value” cost to transport HHG at the maximum PCS weight allowance from the old PDS to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>E.  Delayed or Deferred Mobile Home Transportation.  The Service member may choose not to move a mobile home when authorized.  Mobile home transportation is authorized on a subsequent PCS to the new PDS from either of the following, whichever distance is greater: </p><p></p><p>1.  The former PDS where the mobile home was not moved.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member’s most recent PDS. </p><p></p><p>F.  Limitations.  Mobile home transportation can be chosen instead of HHG transportation.  This choice is available for PCS moves within the CONUS, within Alaska, or between the CONUS and Alaska.  Selection of mobile home transportation does not allow unaccompanied baggage or HHG transportation unless the HHG was removed from the mobile home for safe transportation.  The Service member may not request or accept payment for PCS HHG weight allowance transportation at Government expense when a mobile home has been moved in connection with the same PCS order. </p><p></p><p>G.  Upon Separation from the Service, Relief from Active Duty, Placement on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL), or Retirement.  A Service member being separated from the Service, relieved from active duty, placed on the TDRL, or retired must turn over his or her mobile home to a Transportation Officer for shipment in accordance with the same time limits as the HHG to be authorized mobile home allowances.  See par. 052012-C for time limits.  </p><p></p><p>H.  Funds Advance.  Advance payment for personally procured mobile home transportation is authorized, limited to the estimated amount allowable.  An advance cannot be paid directly to a carrier.</p><p></p><p>052302.  Geographic Limitations </p><p></p><p>A Service member, dependent, or heir may be authorized mobile home transportation allowances between the geographic locations in Table 5-58.  The cost limitation for shipping a mobile home is what the cost to the Government would have been to transport the HHG at the PCS HHG weight allowance between the old PDS and new PDS. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-58.

Through Canada en route between one point in the CONUS and another, such as traveling from Buffalo, New York to Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>f.  From the old PDS in the CONUS or in Alaska to a border crossing point or appropriate port.</p><p>g.  From a border crossing point or appropriate port in the CONUS to a new PDS in the CONUS or in Alaska or from a border crossing point or appropriate port in Alaska to a new PDS in Alaska.</p><p>2</p><p>Appropriate Port </p><p>A port within CONUS or Alaska ordinarily used when a mobile home is transported at personal expense between a port in the CONUS or Alaska and a PDS neither in the CONUS nor Alaska.</p><p>3</p><p>Border Crossing Point </p><p>A border crossing point ordinarily used for mobile home movement between the CONUS, or Alaska, and either Canada or Mexico.</p><p></p><p>0524  TRANSPORTATION</p><p></p><p>052401.  Government-Procured Transportation for Short-Distance Moves </p><p></p><p>The Service member or dependent or heir must own the mobile home when it is moved.  When the Installation Commander orders the Service member to vacate the premises (Government or local housing) he or she is authorized Government-procured transportation or reimbursement for expenses incurred, including storage in transit (SIT), to move the mobile home to another location in the PDS vicinity.  Reimbursable expenses associated with moving a mobile home are listed in Table 5-59.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-59.  Reimbursable Expenses for a Mobile Home Move</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.

Repairs or maintenance performed en route, including structural repairs, brake repairs, and parts or tire replacement.</p><p>h.  Storage accruing at any location unless caused by conditions beyond the Service member’s control.</p><p></p><p>B.  Cost Limitation.  The transportation cost limitation in this part does not apply to short-distance moves.  There is no cost constraint nor is the Service member limited to  the cost of transporting 18,000 pounds of HHG.  </p><p></p><p>052402.  Government-Procured Transportation</p><p></p><p>The Service member may turn over their mobile home to the Government for transportation to the new PDS or authorized location.  The Government pays all transportation costs up to what it would have cost the Government to transport the Service member’s PCS HHG weight allowance from the old PDS to the new PDS.  These costs include pickup, transportation, and delivery of the mobile home to the destination ready for occupancy.  Other reimbursable expenses are listed in Table 5-60.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-60.

It is cumulative with accrual from any combination of the origin, in transit, or at the destination.  The law limits SIT to no more than 180 days.  The Service member is financially responsible for all SIT costs when a mobile home is placed in storage under a PCS order but not transported, with limited exceptions.  When storage facilities are unavailable at the origin or the destination, storage may be in the nearest available storage facility authorized or approved by the Transportation Officer. </p><p></p><p>A.  Costs</p><p></p><p>1.  In computing the storage periods, the SIT is based on actual storage dates, not on a monthly rate,  regardless of billing practices. </p><p></p><p>2.  When computing the authorized allowance, the SIT cost is excluded when comparing the mobile home transportation total cost with the Service member’s PCS weight allowance transportation total cost.</p><p></p><p>B.  Time Limits.  A Service member is authorized mobile home SIT at Government expense for 90 days with any authorized mobile home transportation.  All accrued storage charges after expiration of the first 90-day period are the Service member’s financial responsibility unless additional storage is authorized or approved.

When conditions arise beyond the Service member’s control and a mobile home must remain in SIT after the first 90 days, the Transportation Officer or other officer designated by the Service concerned may authorize the Service member 90 days of additional storage. </p><p></p><p>C.  Order Amended or Modified.  A Service member whose PCS order is amended or modified before he or she arrives at the initially directed new PDS is authorized the storage type under the original PCS order.  The authorization is valid from the date the mobile home was released to a transportation service provider or the Government for shipment or SIT until the amended or modified order’s effective date.  On that effective date, the amended or modified PCS order establishes the storage allowance. </p><p></p><p>D.  Order Canceled or Revoked.  A Service member whose PCS order is canceled or revoked after the date a mobile home is released to a transportation service provider or the Government for shipment or SIT, is authorized the storage type under the original PCS order until the date of cancellation or revocation.  After the PCS order is canceled or revoked, the Service member is authorized SIT with mobile home return shipment and delivery to an authorized place. </p><p></p><p>E.  Another PCS Order Is Issued after the Service Member Arrives at the New PDS.  A Service member who receives another PCS order after arriving at a new PDS while the mobile home is in SIT, is authorized continued SIT until either the new PCS order’s effective date or for 180 days, whichever occurs first.  The new PCS order establishes the subsequent storage authorization. </p><p>0525  MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION WHEN AN ACTIVE-DUTY SERVICE MEMBER IS ILL, INJURED, OR REPORTED ABSENT FOR 30 OR MORE DAYS IN A MISSING STATUS, OR UPON DEATH </p><p></p><p>A.  Authorization.  A dependent otherwise authorized to transport the HHG, is authorized mobile home transportation for use as a residence when official notice is received that the Service member: </p><p></p><p>1.  Died while on active duty or while authorized basic pay. </p><p></p><p>2.  Is injured or ill and the anticipated period of hospitalization or treatment is expected to be of prolonged duration as shown by a statement of the receiving hospital’s commanding officer . </p><p></p><p>3.  Is absent for 30 or more days in a missing status. </p><p></p><p>B.  Transportation.  Transportation is authorized to a Service member’s official HOR or to another location authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process and by one or a combination of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  Government-arranged transportation. </p><p></p><p>2.  Personally arranged transportation using a commercial transporter. </p><p></p><p>3.  Transportation by a means other than Government-arranged or personally arranged.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reimbursement of Transportation and Incidental Costs.  Transportation and incidental costs incurred while transporting a mobile home under this subparagraph are at Government expense.  The limits elsewhere in this Part do not apply.  </p><p></p><p>D.  Additional Moves.  A mobile home transported under this paragraph may again be transported when the Service member has officially been reported as absent for more than 1 year in a missing status, when, through the Secretarial Process, it is determined the circumstances justify an additional move.</p><p></p><p>E.  Advance Payment.  An advance of mobile home allowances is authorized and paid in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy) for DoD Services or Agencies and Service regulations for non-DoD Services.</p><p></p><p>F.  Death of a Service Member.  When a Service member with a mobile home dies on active duty, one dependent of the Service member is authorized mobile home transportation allowances from the mobile home location on the date of death to a place designated by that dependent, provided all of the following conditions are met:  </p><p></p><p>1.  The mobile home is used by the dependent as a residence at the destination.  </p><p></p><p>2.  Mobile home transportation is completed within 1 year after the Service member’s death unless an extension is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>3.  For Government-procured transportation, the mobile home is turned over to a Transportation Officer within 1 year after the Service member’s death unless an extension is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>0526  EXCESS MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION COSTS FOR A SERVICE MEMBER SEPARATED OR DECEASED, OR HEIRS OF A DECEASED SERVICE MEMBER </p><p></p><p>A.  Financial Responsibility.  The Government is obligated only for the total authorized cost to transport a mobile home.  The Service member, a dependent, or heir must sign a written agreement to be financially responsible for all excess costs.  This includes excess distance charges, excess HHG charges, and costs not allowed as listed in this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>B.  Unique Circumstances .  Transportation of a mobile home that involves excess costs may be paid initially by the Government.  However, excess costs must be subsequently reimbursed by the Service member or heir when a Service member is:  </p><p></p><p>1.  Discharged, resigns, or separates from active duty resulting in a non-pay status. </p><p></p><p>2.  Deceased. </p><p></p><p>3.  Authorized by Service regulations. </p><p></p><p>0527  MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION UNDER UNUSUAL OR EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES  </p><p></p><p>A.  Dependent Travel before the Service Member’s PCS due to Official or Personal Situations.  See PDT computation example 16.</p><p></p><p>1.  When disciplinary action is taken against a Service member stationed OCONUS, or when he or she is discharged under other than honorable conditions, or sentenced to confinement with or without discharge, the Service member is authorized mobile home transportation for one of the following moves:</p><p></p><p>a.  To a designated place in the CONUS or Alaska.  </p><p></p><p>b.  From a point outside the CONUS and Alaska to a designated place in Alaska. </p><p></p><p>2.  Authorized Transportation for Dependent Travel </p><p></p><p>a.  Mobile home transportation under this subparagraph is instead of transporting the HHG except as authorized when a Service member is stationed OCONUS or in Alaska and both of the following occur:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Dependents are returned to CONUS or Alaska under Early Return of Dependents or categories in Chapter 5, Part B.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The Service member chooses mobile home allowances instead of HHG allowances within or between CONUS or Alaska under this paragraph or under section 0528.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member is also authorized HHG and unaccompanied baggage transportation from the OCONUS or Alaska PDS to the designated place except for the HHG removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements. </p><p></p><p>3.  Dependent Travel before the New PDS</p><p></p><p>a.  The order authorizing dependent transportation in Chapter 5, Part B or in par. 052801, also may authorize mobile home transportation.  The order should specify the authority that justifies the special circumstances for the transportation authorization.</p><p></p><p>b.  After a mobile home is transported due to dependent travel and transportation before issuance of a PCS order, no further mobile home transportation is authorized before the Service member’s next PCS from the PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>4.  Service Member Assigned to Full PCS Weight Allowance Area.  The Government’s financial responsibility for mobile home and HHG  transportation to the designated place is limited to the Government’s cost to transport the Service member’s PCS HHG weight allowance from the PDS OCONUS to the designated place. </p><p></p><p>5.  Service Member Assigned to Administratively Weight-Restricted Area </p><p></p><p>a.  The mobile home may be transported from a point in the CONUS or Alaska to the designated place.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The Government’s financial responsibility for mobile home and HHG transportation is in accordance with the eligibility requirements in the beginning of this section.  The authorization to transport the Service member’s HHG is limited to the PCS HHG weight allowance, minus the weight of HHG transported from OCONUS, from either of the following: </p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member’s last PDS in the CONUS or Alaska.  </p><p></p><p>(2)  The port in the CONUS or Alaska through which the Service member’s HHG from OCONUS would be transported to the designated place, whichever is to the Service member’s advantage. </p><p></p><p>B.  Mobile Home Transportation Due to Alert Notice</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member authorized HHG transportation due to an alert notice is authorized mobile home transportation to a designated place in the CONUS or Alaska, if the eligibility requirements in par. 052301 are met. </p><p></p><p>2.  When a mobile home is transported after an alert notice, but the Service member’s movement to the dependent-restricted PDS OCONUS is canceled, subsequent mobile home transportation is authorized to the Service member’s PDS if the PDS is in the CONUS or Alaska.</p><p></p><p>3.  When the PDS is in Canada, Mexico, or other parts of Central America, authorization is limited to the cost to the Government to transport the Service member’s HHG PCS weight allowance between the old PDS and new PDS. </p><p></p><p>C.  Mobile Home Transportation Due to Tour Extension .  A Service member on a tour at a PDS  for less than the specified tour length, who used the mobile home authorization when assigned to that PDS, is authorized mobile home transportation at Government expense from the place where the mobile home is located to the PDS, limited to the authorization from the old PDS to the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>1.  This authorization also applies if a Service member initially chooses not to move a mobile home to that PDS due to the anticipated short assignment. </p><p></p><p>2.  The authorization is limited to that situation when the tour is extended due to unusual circumstances and the needs of the Service. </p><p></p><p>D.  Breakdown, Damage, or Destruction of a Mobile Home en Route .  When a mobile home delivery to the authorized destination is prevented by breakdown, damage, or destruction of the mobile home while en route under circumstances beyond the Service member’s control, mobile home allowances are authorized to the point where the mobile home was transported.  </p><p></p><p>1.  The Service member may then transport the HHG that was removed from the mobile home to meet safety requirements. </p><p></p><p>2.  Total transportation cost is limited to the Government’s constructed cost, which is the total cost to transport the Service member’s PCS HHG weight allowance from the old PDS to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>E.  Improper Shipments .  When a mobile home is transported to an improper destination through no fault of the Service member, the mobile home may be transported from there to the proper destination upon authorization or approval from the appropriate Service’s Transportation Officer.  The Service member is responsible for the excess costs that would have been incurred had the shipment been transported to the proper destination by the direct route. </p><p></p><p>F.  Order Amended, Modified, Canceled, or Revoked .  When the Service member personally procures mobile home transportation and the PCS order is amended, modified, canceled, or revoked, the Service member is responsible for modifying the mobile home transportation arrangements.  The distance is computed in accordance with the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD)from the origin or destination within the CONUS or Alaska.  The Service member is authorized mobile home allowances for one of the following moves: </p><p></p><p>1.  To the original destination as if the transportation was completed.  </p><p></p><p>2.  To the point the mobile home was intercepted en route and then to the ultimate new PDS. </p><p></p><p>3.  To another place authorized in this Part.  </p><p></p><p>4.  For return to the old PDS, as appropriate. </p><p></p><p>G.  Transportation before an Order Is Issued .  When required by necessity, as determined by the appropriate official of the Service concerned, a Service member’s mobile home may be transported before a PCS order is issued when the Service member has personally procured transportation arrangements for the mobile home in the same manner as his or her HHG.  The request for transportation must be supported by all of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  A statement from the AO or designated representative that the Service member was previously advised that the order would be issued.  The Service member should retain the AO’s or designated representative’s written certification that the Service member was advised before the mobile home was transported that this PCS order would be issued in case finance regulations require submission of that certification with the reimbursement voucher. </p><p></p><p>2.  A signed agreement by the applicant to pay any additional costs incurred for transportation to another point required because the new PDS named in the order is different than that named in the AO’s statement. .</p><p></p><p>3.  A signed agreement by the applicant to pay the entire transportation cost if a PCS order is not later issued to authorize the transportation.  A Service member is authorized reimbursement only if a PCS order is later issued. </p><p></p><p>4.  The length of time before the PCS order is issued, during which a Service member may be advised that an order will be issued, is limited to the relatively short period between the time when a determination is made to order the Service member perform a PCS and the date on which the order is actually issued. </p><p></p><p>5.  General information furnished to the Service member concerning order issuance before the determination is made to actually issue the order (such as the time of eventual release from active duty, time when the service term expires, retirement eligibility date, expected rotation date from duty OCONUS) is not advice that the order will be issued. </p><p></p><p>H.  Mobile Home Transportation from a Previous PDS.  The Service member or dependent is responsible for notifying the AO of the mobile home’s location if it is not at the current PDS.  If the mobile home was not moved from a prior PDS, then mobile home allowances from the last PDS may be authorized at any combination of the point of origin, in transit, or at the destination. </p><p></p><p>0528  MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION RELATED TO EARLY RETURN OF DEPENDENTS (ERD) </p><p></p><p>The order granting the dependent’s transportation authorization may also authorize HHG or mobile home transportation and must specify the regulatory authority.  When a mobile home is transported due to an authorized Early Return of Dependents (ERD), no further mobile home transportation is authorized before the Service member’s next PCS from the PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>A.  Mobile Home Transportation Instead of HHG Shipping.  Mobile home transportation instead of shipping the HHG may be authorized to a designated place in the CONUS or from a point outside the CONUS to a designated place in Alaska. </p><p></p><p>B.  Service Member Assigned to Full PCS Weight Allowance Area.  The amount the Government pays for mobile home and HHG transportation to the designated place is limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport the Service member’s PCS weight allowance from the PDS OCONUS to the designated place. </p><p></p><p>C.  Service Member Assigned to Administrative Weight-Restricted Area .  The mobile home may be transported from a point in the CONUS or Alaska to the designated place.</p><p></p><p>1.  The Government’s cost for transporting the mobile home is limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport the Service member’s PCS weight allowance from one of the following, minus the weight of the HHG transported from OCONUS:  </p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member’s last PDS in the CONUS or Alaska. </p><p>b.  A port in the CONUS or Alaska through which the Service member’s HHG from OCONUS would be shipped to the designated place, whichever is to the Service member’s advantage. </p><p></p><p>2.  If a Service member owned a mobile home and was authorized to move it to the last PDS in the CONUS while serving there, but chose not to do so, then the mobile home may be transported at Government expense from that location to the Service member’s last PDS in the CONUS or Alaska when the dependent returns early from an administrative weight-restricted area.  The Government’s constructed cost for this mobile home transportation is based on the Service member’s PCS weight allowance on the order’s effective date from that location. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART E:  POV TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE (SERVICE MEMBERS)</p><p></p><p>0529  SHIPMENT OF A POV IN THE CONUS </p><p></p><p>052901.

Two Service members married to each other who both receive PCS orders may ship two POVs or combine their 20-measurement-ton limitation and ship one large POV at Government expense, limited to the total cost the Government would have paid to ship two POVs. </p><p></p><p>3.  Port or Vehicle-Processing Center (VPC) Used.  The Service concerned designates the ports or VPCs used.  In the absence of a designation, the port or VPC serving the origin point and the port or VPC serving the new PDS, Point of Debarkation (POD) and any port in between the old and new PDS are the authorized loading and unloading points for a POV.  </p><p></p><p>a.  From Old to New PDS.  When POV transportation is authorized, one POV NTE 20 measurement tons may be transported from the POV port/VPC serving the old PDS or a POV port/VPC serving the passenger POD or any POV port/VPC in between the old and new PDS to the: </p><p></p><p>(1)  POV unloading port/VPC serving the new PDS; </p><p></p><p>(2)  POV unloading port/VPC serving another authorized place </p><p></p><p>(3)  New PDS if authorized/approved by the Secretarial Process for locations requiring approval; or </p><p></p><p>b.

The HOR, PLEAD, or authorized HOS is considered the new PDS for POV transportation upon separation or retirement.</p><p></p><p>d.  A POV may be shipped between ports or VPCs other than those designated by the Service concerned on the condition that the Service member reimburses the Government for all excess costs involved.</p><p></p><p>(1)  Alternate ports or VPCs OCONUS should be in the same country as the designated port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Alternate ports or VPCs in a different country must be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  A Service member is not required to go through the Secretarial Process when he or she selects an alternate port in the CONUS to ship a POV, even if the primary port or VPC is OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>e.  A POV shipped from a port or VPC OCONUS to the designated port or VPC in the CONUS may be reshipped to another port or VPC in the CONUS if all of the following occur: </p><p></p><p>(1)  The reshipment is authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The PCS order is amended or modified before the Service member takes delivery of the POV at the designated unloading port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>(3)  The Service member agrees to reimburse the Government for the reshipment cost.</p><p></p><p>(4)  Direct ocean service is not available from the designated POV loading port or VPC to the designated POV unloading port or to the VPC in a reasonable amount of time after POV delivery.</p><p></p><p>4.  Unit Moves.  A Service member who is on a PCS order to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS due to a unit move may be provided POV transportation from the unit’s old PDS to the designated POV loading port or VPC and from the designated POV unloading port or VPC to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>5.  Travel Hazards.  A Service member who is on a PCS order to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS may be provided POV transportation between the PDS OCONUS and the port OCONUS or VPC if authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process due to one of the following reasons: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Travel hazards exist between the port or VPC and the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The Service member is physically unable to drive between the port or VPC and the PDS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  The conditions of the Service member’s assignment or PCS order justify overland travel as a prudent alternative.</p><p></p><p>6.  Allowance for POV Delivery Pick up or Drop Off .  A Service member who is authorized POV transportation when ordered on a PCS is also authorized reimbursement to deliver or pick up the POV from the designated loading and unloading ports or VPC.</p><p></p><p>a.  A Service member whose POV pick-up or POV delivery is a separate trip from his or her en route PCS travel is authorized round-trip transportation at the automobile mileage rate from the old PDS to the designated loading port or VPC and from the unloading port or VPC to the new PDS.  PCS travel time is allowed and computed for the round trips to deliver and pick up the POV in par. 050205.</p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member and his or her dependent who pick up or deliver a POV concurrently with PCS travel are authorized the following when the PCS does not involve a TDY en route:</p><p></p><p>(1)  PCS allowances for direct travel from the old PDS to the designated POV loading port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Reimbursement for transportation from the POV loading port or VPC to the passenger port. </p><p>(3)  PCS allowances for travel from the old PDS to the passenger port for the Service member and his or her dependent, from the location where the dependent is dropped off, and from the passenger port to the designated POV loading port or VPC for the Service member.  Reimbursement for the Service member to return to the passenger port is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>(4)  PCS allowances for direct travel from the passenger port to the designated POV unloading port or VPC and then to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>c.  A Service member who has a TDY en route with a PCS and who delivers a POV to a designated POV port or VPC is authorized all of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  A MALT for the official distance from the old PDS to the TDY en route location plus per diem.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A MALT for the official distance from the TDY location to the designated POV port or VPC plus per diem.</p><p></p><p>(3)  PCS allowances for direct travel from the designated POV port or VPC to the passenger port.</p><p></p><p>d.  A dependent who delivers the POV or accompanies a Service member who is delivering a POV is authorized the same allowances as when a dependent joins or accompanies the Service member during TDY en route.</p><p></p><p>e.  When a dependent picks up the POV from the designated POV port or VPC without traveling to the TDY en route location, PCS allowances are authorized for direct travel from the passenger port to the designated POV unloading port or VPC, then to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>7.  Responsibility for POV after Delivery.  The Government’s responsibility begins when the POV is accepted for transportation and continues until the POV is delivered either to the Service member at the destination or to a commercial warehouse.  A POV that is not claimed within a reasonable time after notification of arrival is provided, as determined by the port commander, may be placed in commercial storage at the Service member’s expense. </p><p></p><p>8.  Transporting a POV before a PCS Order Is Issued.  An eligible Service member may transport a POV before a PCS order is issued when all of the following criteria are met:</p><p></p><p>a.  The PCS AO or designated representative provides a supporting statement that he or she advised the Service member ahead of time that the PCS order would be issued.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The time between when the Service member is advised that the PCS order will be issued and when the actual PCS order is issued must be a relatively short period.</p><p></p><p>(2)  General information provided to the Service member, such as the eventual release from active duty, retirement eligibility, or the expected rotation date from duty OCONUS, does not constitute advice that a PCS order will be issued.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member agrees in writing to reimburse the Government for the entire cost of transporting the POV if a PCS order is not issued or if the PCS order does not authorize transportation of a POV once it is issued.</p><p></p><p>c.  The Service member agrees to pay any additional costs for reshipping the POV to another port due to a change in the PDS from the PDS named in the PCS AO’s supporting statement. </p><p></p><p>9.  Transporting a POV and Dependent Does not Travel OCONUS.  A Service member with a dependent who transports a POV to the PDS OCONUS anticipating that the dependent will join him or her may be authorized or approved the advance return transportation of the POV through the Secretarial Process when circumstances beyond the Service member’s control prevent the dependent’s transportation.  It must be in the best interest of the Service member, the dependent, and the Government.  If advance return of the POV is approved, the Service member has no further POV transportation authority on the PCS order from that PDS. </p><p></p><p>10.  Disciplinary Action Taken Against Service Member OCONUS.  A Service member stationed OCONUS who has disciplinary action taken against him or her, is discharged under other than honorable conditions, or sentenced to confinement with or without discharge when no dependent travel is involved is authorized POV transportation to the designated POV unloading port or VPC of the Service member’s HOR or PLEAD. </p><p></p><p>11.  Reassignment from Accompanied PDS OCONUS to Unaccompanied PDS OCONUS before POV Is Transported.  When a Service member is on a PCS order from a PDS in the CONUS to a PDS OCONUS where dependents and a POV are authorized, and is reassigned after arriving at the new PDS to a PDS OCONUS where dependents and a POV are not authorized, then the POV cannot be shipped to the newly assigned PDS.  If the Service member delivered a POV to a loading port or VPC in the CONUS for shipment to a PDS OCONUS and the POV has not already shipped, then he or she may be authorized transportation to pick up the POV from the unloading port or VPC that ordinarily serves the CONUS designated place. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-65.  Factors Affecting POV Transportation OCONUS</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a POV is transported by the Government to the wrong place,</p><p>the POV must be reshipped, or transferred from one ship (or other form of transportation) to another and transported, to the proper destination at Government expense.</p><p>2</p><p>a Service member authorized to transport his or her POV at Government expense chooses not to do so,</p><p>he or she may select the greater of the following options upon assignment to a new PDS where a POV is authorized:</p><p>a.  Transportation of the POV from the PDS where </p><p>     the Service member chose to leave the POV to the POV unloading port or VPC of the newly assigned PDS.</p><p>b.  Transportation of a POV from the Service member’s current PDS to the POV unloading port or VPC of the newly assigned PDS. </p><p>3</p><p>an eligible Service member transports a POV due to a PCS order and that order is later amended, modified, canceled, or revoked,</p><p>he or she may have the POV reshipped at Government expense.  This includes having his or her POV returned to the old PDS. </p><p>4</p><p>a Service member divorces or has his or her marriage annulled while stationed OCONUS,</p><p>the Service member or previously command-sponsored dependent may be authorized transportation allowances for a POV.  See par. 053302.</p><p>5</p><p>an eligible Service member is separating from the Service or being relieved from active duty,</p><p>he or she must turn in his or her POV to the designated POV loading port for transportation before the 181st day from his or her separation or relief from active duty.  An extension for a specific additional time period may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process if POV transportation within the initial time period would create a hardship for the Service member.  See par. 051002 for restrictions to time limitations. </p><p>6</p><p>an eligible Service member retires or is placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL), discharged with severance or separation pay, or involuntarily released from active duty with readjustment or separation pay,</p><p>he or she must turn in his or her POV to the designated POV loading port for transportation within 1 year following his or her active service termination.  An extension for up to 1 year may be approved through the Secretarial Process when a Service member is undergoing hospitalization, medical treatment, education, training, or other justifiable situations.  See par. 051003 for restrictions to time limitations.  </p><p>7</p><p>an eligible Service member is authorized to transport a POV on a PCS order,</p><p>he or she may ship the POV any time while the PCS order remains in effect.  The POV must be shipped before the receipt of another PCS order.  The POV transportation must be related to the Service member’s PCS rather than for personal reasons. </p><p></p><p>053002.  POV Transportation when Transportation to the PDS OCONUS is not Authorized </p><p></p><p>A.  Reasons a POV is not Transported to the PDS OCONUS.  A POV may not be transported to a PDS OCONUS under any of the following reasons:</p><p></p><p>1.  POV transportation is not permitted to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service member serves a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied tour and he or she elects not to have a POV transported to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>3.  The Service member elects not to have a POV transported to the new PDS when concurrent travel of a dependent has been denied and the dependent has moved to a designated place.</p><p></p><p>B.  Situation Authorizing Transportation of One POV.  When a POV is not transported due to one of the reasons in 053002.A, but is required for the Service member’s or dependent’s use, the Service member is authorized transportation of one POV to a destination other than the new PDS.  The transportation is from the designated POV loading port or VPC ordinarily serving the Service member’s old PDS to the designated POV unloading port or VPC ordinarily serving one of the following locations:</p><p></p><p>1.  Any place in the CONUS that the Service member designates, if the old PDS is OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Alaska, Hawaii, or any U.S. territory or possession where dependent transportation is authorized.</p><p></p><p>3.  Any location OCONUS where dependent transportation is authorized when the Service member is on an accompanied tour immediately after completing the dependent-restricted tour or a tour under unusually arduous sea duty, and the Service member has sufficient time in service remaining to complete the dependent-restricted tour and the tour immediately thereafter.</p><p>4.  A location OCONUS that has been justified under unusual conditions or circumstances and authorized or approved by the Secretary concerned.  This authority may not be delegated below the Service headquarters that directs dependent travel and transportation policy and procedures.  For the Armed Forces, the Secretary concerned may only authorize a location OCONUS to return a foreign-born dependent to the spouse’s native country in accordance with DoDI 1315.18 (Military Personnel Assignments).  The Commandant of the Coast Guard (CG-13) may make an exception for a Coast Guard member.</p><p></p><p>C.  Subsequent Transportation</p><p></p><p>1.  When a Service member is on a dependent-restricted tour or an unaccompanied tour at a PDS OCONUS and receives command sponsorship of a dependent at the PDS, he or she is authorized transportation of one POV.  Transportation is from the POV loading port, or VPC serving the location where a dependent was previously moved at Government expense, to the POV unloading port or VPC serving the Service member’s PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation of one POV is authorized when a Service member is ordered on a PCS to a PDS where a POV transportation is permitted, or where dependent transportation is authorized.  The transportation is authorized from the POV loading port or VPC serving the place where a POV was shipped (see par. 053002-A) to the POV unloading port or VPC serving the Service member’s new PDS.</p><p></p><p>053003.  Replacement POV Shipment </p><p></p><p>A.  Authorization.  When the POV that was transported to an area OCONUS at Government expense is no longer adequate for the Service member’s transportation needs, a replacement POV may be authorized through the Secretarial Process.  A POV may be replaced if authorized and only if one of the following conditions exists:</p><p></p><p>1.  The POV has deteriorated due to severe climatic conditions.</p><p></p><p>2.  The POV was lost through fire, theft, or similar cases.</p><p></p><p>3.  The POV has worn out due to age and normal deterioration and the Service member is on consecutive tours of duty OCONUS (B-212338, December 27, 1983).</p><p></p><p>B.  Limitation.  A Service member may transport only one replacement POV during any 4-year period when the POV being transported replaces a POV that is worn out due to age and normal deterioration.</p><p></p><p>053004.  POV Purchased in a Non-Foreign Area OCONUS </p><p></p><p>POV transportation is not authorized when a Service member purchases a POV in a non-foreign area OCONUS and is not permanently assigned in that non-foreign area OCONUS at the time of the purchase.  A Service member may be authorized POV transportation when the POV is purchased in a non-foreign OCONUS area if the POV is used by the Service member or his or her dependent at the PDS OCONUS or to an alternate transportation port and it is authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>0531  POV SHIPMENT AND STORAGE WHEN SERVICE MEMBER REPORTED AS ILL, INJURED, ABSENT FOR A PERIOD OF 30 OR MORE DAYS IN A MISSING STATUS, OR DEAD</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member on active duty is authorized POV transportation when he or she is:</p><p></p><p>1.  Injured or ill and the Service concerned accepts a statement by a medical authority that hospitalization or treatment is anticipated for 140 or more days.</p><p></p><p>2.  Absent for a period of 30 or more days in a missing status.</p><p></p><p>3.  Officially reported as dead.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation.  The AO may authorize transportation for two POVs.  The destination must be one of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member’s HOR.</p><p></p><p>b.  The dependent’s residence.</p><p></p><p>c.  Location of the next of kin, or person authorized to receive custody of the Service member’s personal items.</p><p></p><p>d.  A place or places as determined by Service regulations.</p><p></p><p>2.  Limitations</p><p></p><p>a.  The 20-measurement-ton restriction does not apply to this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>b.  POVs may be driven by the dependent, next of kin, or any person authorized to receive custody of the Service member’s personal items.  Both POVs must be driven to the same destination.</p><p></p><p>(1)  Reimbursement is authorized for road, bridge, and tunnel tolls; fuel; oil; parking fees; and ferry fares.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A mileage reimbursement is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>c.  Arranged transportation must be to the same authorized destination.</p><p></p><p>d.  When POV transportation is personally procured, the total reimbursement is limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport and store the POVs.  Reimbursement is also limited to the cost of over-water and overland transportation between the authorized points or between the actual locations where the POV is transported, whichever is less.</p><p></p><p>e.  A rental car is authorized when POVs are transported at Government expense and do not arrive at the authorized destination by the designated delivery date.  Reimbursement for a rental car is limited to $30 per day and a maximum of 7 days.  If two POVs are transported at Government expense, then no rental car reimbursement is authorized unless both POVs do not arrive at the authorized destination by the designated delivery date.</p><p></p><p>3.  Storage</p><p></p><p>a.  POVs transported at Government expense for a Service member under this paragraph may be placed in non-temporary storage (NTS) at Government expense when the person authorized to receive custody of the POVs is unknown, subject to litigation, or known but not located or notified to take custody of the POVs.  Storage is authorized until proper disposition can be made. </p><p></p><p>b.  Storage in transit (SIT) may be authorized or approved for one or both of the POVs to the nearest available storage facility provided the POVs are turned over for transportation within the time limitations in Table 5-49.  In this circumstance, the Service member’s POVs are not restricted to the maximum standard size usually allowed by the military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) storage contract.  SIT of 181 or more days becomes the financial responsibility of the person to whom the POV shipment is being made.</p><p></p><p>4.  Subsequent POV Transportation.  One or both POVs, transported at Government expense when a Service member is reported dead, ill, injured, or absent for a period of 30 or more days in a missing status, may be transported again if either of the following occur:</p><p></p><p>a.  The status of the Service member changes within these same categories.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member is officially reported as absent for a period of more than 1 year in a missing status.  The additional move must be approved through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p></p><p>0532  POV STORAGE</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  Storage for one POV may be authorized if a Service member is:</p><p></p><p>a.  Ordered to a foreign or non-foreign PDS OCONUS where POV transportation is not permitted due to the country, area, U.S. laws, regulations, other restrictions, or the extensive modification of the POV required as a condition of entry.</p><p></p><p>b.  Sent on a TDY in support of a contingency operation for more than 30 days. </p><p></p><p>c.  Sent on a TDY in support of humanitarian assistance or other emergency operations as declared by an Executive Order or by the administering Secretary.  In this circumstance, POV storage must be authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>d.  Authorized POV transportation due to his or her ship’s home port change when 31 or more days are between the ship’s departure from the old home port and its arrival at the new home port.</p><p></p><p>e.  Authorized a POV due to a unit PCS and the unit is deployed 31 days or more en route. </p><p>2.  A Service member is eligible for POV storage if a PCS order, a contingency operation’s TDY order, or the start of an in-place consecutive overseas tour (IPCOT) has an effective date on or after April 1, 1997. </p><p></p><p>Note:  POV storage when transportation is authorized is not allowed.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  POV storage is instead of POV shipment both to and from the foreign PDS OCONUS to which POV shipment is prohibited.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member who is authorized POV storage: </p><p></p><p>a.  Is not authorized POV shipment from his or her foreign location OCONUS when he or she performs a subsequent PCS.</p><p></p><p>b.  Can ship the stored POV to a subsequent foreign PDS OCONUS if the Service member performs a consecutive overseas tour (COT) and POV transportation is permitted to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>c.  Cannot continue to store the POV at Government expense while shipping another POV to the subsequent PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Cannot ship a POV that is removed from storage before departing the PDS OCONUS on a PCS order or beginning an IPCOT.</p><p></p><p>e.  Can be authorized shipment of a POV removed from storage upon a COT or IPCOT when performing a PCS after the COT or IPCOT is completed.</p><p></p><p>2.  A POV that is eligible for storage must adhere to the maximum size restrictions of the SDDC storage contract.  A Service member is financially responsible for all excess storage costs resulting from a vehicle’s excess size.  These costs are collected in accordance with the Service regulations unless one of the criteria below is met:</p><p></p><p>a.  An oversized POV may be authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process if it is required by the Service member or his or her dependents for medical reasons.  </p><p></p><p>b.  If a Service member is married to a Service member and both Service members are each authorized to store one POV, they may store one oversized vehicle instead of storing two POVs.  The cost for the storage of one oversized POV is limited to what the Government would have paid for the storage of two standard size POVs.</p><p></p><p>3.  The Services may designate, through the Secretarial Process, POV storage facilities.  </p><p></p><p>a.  If Government storage is available, then a Service member may personally arrange POV storage at either the Service-designated facility or a commercial storage facility other than the Service-designated facility.  A Service member may be reimbursed for travel to and from a commercial storage facility, limited to the cost of travel to a Service-designated storage facility.  Reimbursement is for the actual storage cost and limited to what it would have cost the Government to store the POV.</p><p></p><p>b.  Storage in a private residence, garage, or on a private lot does not constitute a commercial facility.  Reimbursement is not authorized for any costs associated with storage in a non-commercial storage facility, which includes transportation costs to or from the storage facility. </p><p></p><p>c.  The actual cost of storage is reimbursable if Government storage is neither available nor designated, or if the Transportation Officer instructed the Service member to store the POV at personal expense. </p><p></p><p>4.  The Service may elect to transport the POV to and from the storage location.</p><p></p><p>a.  If Government-procured transportation is available and the Service member chooses to personally arrange transportation, then he or she is limited to the Government’s constructed-transportation cost.  The Government’s constructed-transportation cost is compared to the total of the following two costs:</p><p></p><p>(1)  The Service member’s actual transportation cost to and from the storage facility. </p><p></p><p>(2)  The automobile mileage rate for the official round-trip distance to and from the storage facility, if the POV is driven</p><p></p><p>b.  If Government-procured transportation is not available or the Service member is instructed by the Transportation Officer to personally arrange POV transportation, then he or she is reimbursed the actual cost of transportation.  If the POV is driven, reimbursement is at the automobile mileage rate for the official round-trip distance to and from the storage facility. </p><p></p><p>c.  If the Service member is traveling to or from OCONUS, and drops off or picks up the POV at the storage facility en route to his or her destination, then he or she is reimbursed for one-way transportation at the automobile mileage rate between the designated storage facility and the authorized location (such as the PDS or VPC or port) limited to the Government’s constructed cost of transporting the POV. </p><p></p><p>5.  An eligible Service member who delivers his or her POV to the storage facility concurrently with PCS travel (with no TDY en route) is authorized both of the following PCS allowances:</p><p></p><p>a.  Direct travel from the old PDS to the designated storage facility and from the designated storage facility to the passenger port of embarkation.</p><p></p><p>b.  Travel for the Service member and his or her dependents from the old PDS to the passenger port of embarkation to drop off dependents and for his or herself from the passenger port of embarkation to the designated storage facility.  Reimbursement is not authorized for return travel to the port of embarkation from the designated storage facility. </p><p></p><p>6.  An eligible Service member who picks up his or her POV from the designated storage facility concurrently with PCS travel (with no TDY en route) is authorized PCS allowances for both his or herself and dependents for direct travel from the passenger’s point of debarkation to the designated storage facility and then to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>7.  An eligible Service member who delivers his or her POV to the designated storage facility due to PCS travel to a foreign PDS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS and then performs a TDY en route is authorized all of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  A MALT, plus per diem at the Standard CONUS per diem rate, for one authorized traveler for the official distance from the old PDS to the TDY location or locations en route.</p><p>b.  MALT for one authorized traveler for the official distance from the TDY location to the designated storage facility.</p><p></p><p>c.  PCS allowances for direct travel from the designated storage facility to the passenger port. </p><p></p><p>8.  An eligible Service member who picks up his or her POV from the designated storage facility to travel on a PCS order and he or she has a TDY en route is authorized all of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  PCS allowances, including per diem, for direct travel from the passenger port to the designated storage facility to pick up the POV.</p><p></p><p>b.  MALT plus per diem, at the Standard CONUS per diem rate, for one authorized passenger for the official distance from the designated storage facility to or from the TDY location.</p><p></p><p>c.  MALT plus per diem, at the Standard CONUS per diem rate, for the official distance to or from the TDY location to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>9.  A dependent who travels with the Service member or who delivers the POV to the designated storage facility is authorized travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>a.  The allowances are based on the travel actually performed using the MALT and per diem rates, limited to the greater of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  MALT for the official distance between authorized points as if the dependent had traveled separately, plus a per diem for dependents, at the rate in par. 050303, for the constructed travel time between the authorized points.</p><p></p><p>(2)  What it would have cost if Government-procured transportation had been used for travel between authorized points, plus a per diem in Chapter 2 for the time required for travel between authorized points.</p><p></p><p>b.  If Government-procured transportation is used, then subtract the cost of Government-procured transportation from the allowances.  </p><p></p><p>10.  A dependent who picks up the POV from the designated storage facility without traveling with the Service member to the TDY location en route is authorized dependent PCS allowances from the port of debarkation to the designated storage facility and then to the new PDS. </p><p></p><p>11.  Storage of a POV may continue in the following circumstances:</p><p></p><p>a.  A POV may remain in storage at Government expense for up to 90 days after the Service member returns from a PDS OCONUS to which the POV could not be shipped or returns after a TDY order for a contingency operation.  All storage charges accrued after 90 days are the Service member’s financial responsibility unless additional storage is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>b.  A Service member with an authorized POV in storage under this section who separates from the Service or is relieved from active duty is authorized continued storage up to 180 days after the date of the active-duty termination unless specifically prohibited in par. 051002.  All storage charges accrued 181 days or later are the Service member’s financial responsibility unless additional storage is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>c.  A Service member with an authorized POV in storage who is retired, placed on the TDRL, discharged with severance or separation pay, involuntarily released from active duty with readjustment or separation pay, or dead is authorized continued POV storage for up to 1 year from the date of active-duty termination.  All storage charges accrued after 365 days are the Service member’s financial responsibility unless additional storage is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process.  An extension may be granted for the circumstances described in par. 051003. </p><p></p><p>d.  A Service member is authorized pick up or delivery of his or her POV at Government expense, regardless of the time in storage, as long as the Service member’s order is valid.  This includes a POV that was stored at Government expense that was converted to storage at the Service member’s expense. </p><p></p><p>12.  A Service member may be authorized a funds advance of POV storage costs in accordance with Service regulations. </p><p></p><p>13.  A POV may be stored by the eligible Service member before a PCS or contingency order is issued when all of the following criteria are met: </p><p></p><p>a.  The AO for the PCS or contingency operation, or his or her designated representative, provides a supporting statement that he or she advised the Service member ahead of time that the PCS or contingency order would be issued.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The time between when the Service member is advised that the PCS or contingency order will be issued and when the actual PCS order is issued must be a relatively short time period.</p><p></p><p>(2)  General information provided to the Service member, such as the eventual release from active duty, retirement eligibility, or the expected rotation date from duty OCONUS, does not constitute advice that a PCS or contingency order will be issued.</p><p></p><p>b.  The Service member agrees in writing to reimburse the Government for the entire cost of storing the POV if a PCS order or contingency order is not issued or if the PCS order or contingency order does not authorize storage of a POV once it is issued.</p><p></p><p>c.  The Service member agrees to pay any additional costs for reshipment of the POV to another storage facility because the PDS named in the issued order is different from the PDS named in the PCS AO’s supporting statement, or because a return to the current PDS is necessary if the contingency order is not issued. </p><p></p><p>14.  A POV that is stored after the Service member receives a PCS or contingency operation order that is later amended, modified, canceled, or revoked may be removed from storage and shipped or reshipped to the proper destination at Government expense.  A POV may not be removed from storage and shipped if the Service member has fewer than 12 months remaining on his or her tour OCONUS.  The exceptions for HHG transportation in par. 051305 also apply to this paragraph. </p><p></p><p>15.  A Service member who is authorized POV storage may exercise this authority at any time as long as the PCS order remains in effect and the POV storage is due to the PCS and not for personal reasons. </p><p></p><p>0533  SEPARATE RETURN OF CURRENT OR FORMER DEPENDENT FROM A PDS OCONUS</p><p></p><p>053301.  POV Transportation for Early Return of Dependents (ERD)</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member who is authorized an Early Return of Dependents (ERD) due to official or personal situations (see par. 050804-F) may be authorized POV transportation for his or her dependents.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A Service member is authorized transportation at Government expense for his or her dependents and household goods to a designated place in the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, a U.S. territory, a possession of the United States, or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to a place in the country of their origin. </p><p></p><p>1.  A dependent authorized travel from a PDS OCONUS under an Early Return of Dependents (ERD), in section 0508, may also be authorized transportation of one POV to the designated POV unloading port or VPC serving the location where the dependent is authorized to travel.  </p><p></p><p>2.  If a POV shipment is en route to the designated OCONUS unloading port or VPC, the authority exists to change the transporter or place of shipment on the effective date of the dependents travel. </p><p></p><p>3.  A dependent who travels from the PDS OCONUS to the authorized destination without an authorized order but under circumstances that permit an order may be authorized or approved transportation for one POV from the designated POV loading port or VPC OCONUS.  If the conditions of par. 050804 are met, then a travel order is issued authorizing dependent travel and POV transportation from the designated POV port or VPC serving the location that dependent travel would have been authorized.  This order must be supported by the Service member’s commanding officer’s determination that:</p><p></p><p>a.  The dependent traveled to an appropriate destination to reside.</p><p></p><p>b.  The dependent meets all of the conditions in par. 050804, except that a travel order for transportation was not issued.</p><p></p><p>c.  The status of the dependent as command-sponsored OCONUS remains unchanged.  This does not apply for a Service member’s former dependent whose transportation could have been authorized under par. 050805.</p><p></p><p>d.  A travel order approving the dependent transportation to an appropriate destination under par. 050804 is in the Government’s best interest. </p><p></p><p>4.  There is no authority for return transportation of a POV to a location OCONUS even if a dependent is permitted to return at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>5.  The shipment of a POV under an ERD order, if authorized and approved, exhausts the Service member’s entitlement to ship a POV from the last or any previous PDS OCONUS to the CONUS. </p><p></p><p></p><p>053302.  POV Transportation OCONUS after Divorce or Annulment</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member stationed OCONUS whose marriage is terminated by divorce or annulment may be authorized transportation allowances for a POV.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member authorized to transport a POV on a PCS order may have the POV transported one last time when his or her POV is legally awarded to the spouse through a divorce. </p><p></p><p>a.  The Service member must transport the POV in accordance with the procedures in section 0530, and agree in writing to pay any excess costs involved.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The POV shipment ends all authority for POV transportation under the Service member’s PCS order. </p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member stationed OCONUS may be authorized POV transportation for a former family member who was a command-sponsored dependent and resided with the Service member. </p><p></p><p>a.  The POV must be turned over to the Transportation Officer for shipment within 1 year after the final decree’s effective date for the divorce or annulment. </p><p></p><p>b.  There is no authority for return transportation of a POV to a location OCONUS even if a dependent is permitted to return at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>0534  RENTAL VEHICLE REIMBURSEMENT WHEN A POV TRANSPORTED AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE ARRIVES LATE </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member or dependent that is authorized POV transportation may be eligible for reimbursement for a rental vehicle when the POV arrives late.  The POV must be transported at Government expense for the Service member’s or a dependent’s use under any of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  PCS orders.</p><p></p><p>2.  An unusual or an emergency circumstance.</p><p></p><p>3.  Various other situations that may not be directly related to a PCS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A POV has not arrived at the authorized destination if it is not available for delivery to the Service member on or before the designated delivery date.  If the Service member’s POV does not arrive at the authorized destination by the designated delivery date, then the Service or Agency must reimburse the Service member for the cost of a rental vehicle for his or her use or a dependent’s use.  Reimbursement for a rental vehicle, by law, is limited to $30 per day with a maximum reimbursement of $210.  The Service member or dependent may rent a vehicle as early as the day after the POV’s scheduled delivery date and keep it for up to 7 days, or less if the POV is available for delivery sooner.  See PDT computation example 14.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART F:  PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION ALLOWANCES (CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES)</p><p></p><p>0535  INTRODUCTION</p><p></p><p>This subchapter specifies relocation information and provides the authority for a civilian employee’s PCS travel and transportation allowances.  This Part implements the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), and provides Department of Defense (DoD) administrative requirements for DoD civilian employees.  It also covers the eligibility for the standard PCS allowances: transportation, per diem, miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, the miscellaneous expense allowance (MEA), temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE), house-hunting trips (HHT), real estate transactions-including lease breaking expense - relocation services, Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance, privately owned vehicle (POV) shipment, and household goods (HHG) and mobile home transportation and storage.  The standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2 apply, unless otherwise indicated in Chapter 5.  PCS allowances are for travel and transportation over a direct, usually traveled route between an old permanent duty station (PDS) and a new PDS, unless specified otherwise in the JTR.</p><p></p><p>0536  STANDARD PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION (PCS) ALLOWANCES (FTR, §302-3)</p><p></p><p>civilian relocation allowances are authorized when the hiring process includes PCS allowances unless specified otherwise in the JTR.  The authorized allowances are transportation for the civilian employee and dependent, per diem for the civilian employee and dependent, miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, MEA, real estate, HHG transportation and storage, and the RIT allowance.  The Agency may not negotiate, deny, or reduce these allowances when the civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements.  The HHT, TQSE, property management services, and transportation allowances for POV shipment are discretionary.  The PCS order must indicate the specific allowances authorized for the relocation and provide instructions about procedures for travel and transportation services.  Section 0536 applies when the hiring process includes PCS allowances.  For travel and transportation eligibility and allowance tables, see FTR, §302-3.</p><p></p><p>053601.  Civilian PCS Transportation Allowance</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who relocates and meets the eligibility requirements is authorized civilian employee and dependent transportation. </p><p></p><p>A.  Transportation Options.  A civilian employee or dependent may choose to: </p><p></p><p>1.  Travel by POV.</p><p></p><p>2.  Personally procure transportation.</p><p></p><p>3.  Travel by Government or Government-procured transportation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Using Multiple Options.  A civilian employee or dependent may use more than one mode of transportation.  If a POV and another mode of transportation is used between official locations, this is mixed-mode travel.  Total reimbursement is limited to monetary allowance in lieu of transportation (MALT) plus per diem for the authorized travel.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Mandatory Government Transportation Use.  An AO may direct the civilian employee or dependent to use Government transportation.  When the directed mode is available and a civilian employee or dependent chooses not to use the directed mode, reimbursement for transportation is not allowed (see par. 020208). </p><p></p><p>D.  Rental Vehicle Use.  A rental vehicle may only be authorized in advance for PCS transportation when other transportation modes are not advantageous to the Government.  If not authorized in advance, and the civilian employee or dependent uses a rental vehicle, it is reimbursed as though a POV was used.</p><p></p><p>053602.  Civilian PCS Per Diem Allowance</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who relocates and meets the eligibility requirements is authorized per diem for him or herself and any dependent.  The reimbursement amount depends on the mode of transportation authorized and used, the official distance, the number and age of dependents authorized to travel, and whether a dependent is traveling with the civilian employee.  See section 0537 and section 0539. </p><p></p><p>053603.  Miscellaneous Reimbursable Expenses</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who relocates and meets the eligibility requirements is authorized reimbursable expenses in Chapter 2. </p><p></p><p>053604.  Miscellaneous Expense Allowance (MEA) </p><p></p><p>The MEA is a separate allowance from the miscellaneous reimbursable expense allowance.  It is paid as a specific set amount or itemized as a reimbursement for the actual expense.  </p><p></p><p>053605.  Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense (TQSE) </p><p></p><p>TQSE is a discretionary allowance intended to partially reimburse a civilian employee for temporary lodging, meals, and incidental expenses incurred when it is necessary for the civilian employee or his or her dependent to occupy temporary lodging during a PCS move. </p><p></p><p>053606.  House-Hunting Trip (HHT) </p><p>An HHT is a discretionary allowance that may be authorized for a civilian employee or spouse to seek a permanent residence at the new PDS.  A domestic partner is not a spouse and cannot be authorized an HHT. </p><p></p><p>053607.  Real Estate Allowances </p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who relocates and meets the eligibility requirements is authorized reimbursement for specific expenses incurred for the sale or purchase of a residence or the settlement of an unexpired lease for a PCS move.  The residence must be located in the continental Unites States (CONUS) or non-foreign area outside the CONUS (OCONUS). </p><p>053608.  Relocation Services</p><p></p><p>Relocation services is a discretionary allowance that a DoD Component may offer an eligible civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>A.  Relocation Services Program.  The DoD National Relocation Program offers authorized transferring DoD civilian employees origin and destination area relocation services, including home marketing assistance, guaranteed home sale, property management services, home finding assistance, and mortgage assistance.  Relocation services company third-party contractors provide DoD National Relocation Program (DNRP) relocation services.</p><p></p><p>B.  Component Responsibilities.  The DoD Component must determine a civilian employee’s eligibility and the extent and conditions for relocation services.  The DoD Component must provide counseling about relocation services as soon as possible after selection of a civilian employee and before a civilian employee transfers within or between DoD Components or to another Agency.  The DoD Component must determine how to monitor and evaluate that counseling.</p><p></p><p>053609.  POV Transportation</p><p></p><p>Transportation allowances for shipping a POV are discretionary.  POV transportation may be authorized or approved by the commanding officer (CONUS) or the overseas command (OCONUS).  A maximum of two POVs may be shipped at Government expense between CONUS locations.  Only one POV may be shipped between CONUS and OCONUS locations or between OCONUS locations.  POV storage is not authorized in connection with a Civilian employee’s PCS.  A civilian employee assigned to a temporary change of station (TCS) for an operational deployment or contingency operation is eligible for POV storage in par. 032905.  A civilian employee is eligible for POV storage in connection with an OCONUS evacuation in par. 060405. </p><p></p><p>053610.  Household Goods (HHG) and Mobile Home Transportation and Storage</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who relocates and meets the eligibility requirements is authorized HHG shipment, including storage in transit (SIT) and non-temporary storage (NTS) of HHG.  However, if a civilian employee chooses to transport a mobile home instead of HHG and meets the requirements in this Part, the civilian employee or dependent must use the mobile home as a primary residence at the location to which it is being moved.</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG.  NTS of HHG is not authorized for a transfer from one location in the CONUS to another location in the CONUS, unless the transfer is to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS.  In the case of any loss or damage to HHG, the civilian employee must submit claims in accordance with applicable Service regulations (FTR §302-7).  HHG must be delivered within the time limits in par. 053712.</p><p></p><p>B.  Mobile Home.  This Part specifies mobile home transportation allowances for a civilian employee relocating due to a PCS order.  Allowances for transporting a mobile home, including mileage when towed by the civilian employee, are in addition to the reimbursement of per diem, MALT, and transportation expenses for the civilian employee and dependent (FTR §302-10).</p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p>053611.  Relocation Income Tax (RIT) Allowance</p><p></p><p>A RIT allowance reimburses a civilian employee for the majority of the additional income taxes incurred from the reimbursement of taxable relocation allowances.  A RIT allowance applies to Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred by the civilian employee or by the civilian employee and spouse, but not by a domestic partner.  A RIT allowance does not reimburse for employment-type taxes, such as those imposed by 26 U.S.C. §21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or 26 U.S.C. §3301-§3311 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act).  A Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) acts as an advance on a RIT.  See FTR §302-17, and GSA Bulletin FTR 18-05, dated May 14, 2018 for details on taxable PCS allowances and computation methods. </p><p></p><p>0537  ELIGIBILITY</p><p></p><p>053701.  Civilian Employee Eligibility</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee must sign a service agreement to receive relocation allowances.  If a civilian employee fails to sign a service agreement, the Government is not financially responsible for his or her relocation expenses for a PCS move.  Those expenses become the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  When a Government-funded PCS is authorized, the AO must issue a written order before a new appointee or civilian employee reports to the first or new official location..  An appointee or civilian employee should not incur PCS expenses before receiving the written order.  Expenses incurred before receipt of a written or verbal order are not reimbursable unless the DoD Agency has provided a clear “administrative intent” to transfer the civilian employee when costs are incurred and subsequently issues orders authorizing reimbursement  (CBCA 3294-RELO, 29 May 2013)  PCS authority extends between Government Agencies.  The civilian employee must have no break in Government service when undertaking a PCS unless he or she separated from Government service due to a reduction in force (RIF) or transfer of function.  Permanent duty changes include the transfer of any of the following: </p><p></p><p>A.  A new appointee from the actual residence to the first PDS to begin work.</p><p></p><p>B.  A civilian employee undergoing PCS travel in the Government’s interest from one PDS to another without a break in service.</p><p></p><p>C.  A civilian employee on renewal agreement travel (RAT), between serving consecutive tours of duty without a break in service, from a PDS OCONUS to the actual residence for leave purposes and return to OCONUS.  Return can be to the PDS OCONUS in the RAT agreement or on the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>D.  A civilian employee separating from a PDS OCONUS and returning to the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>E.  A former civilian employee separated due to a RIF or transfer of function who is re-employed within 1 year of separation under non-temporary appointments at a PDS other than the one at which separated.</p><p></p><p>F.  A civilian employee who qualifies for travel and transportation allowances to a last move home upon separation from Government service.</p><p></p><p>G.  A career Senior Executive Service (SES) appointee, including a prior SES appointee who chose to retain SES retirement travel and transportation allowances, upon retirement and return to the appointee’s selected residence.</p><p></p><p>H.  A civilian employee who, without a break in service of more than 3 days, transfers from a DoD non-appropriated fund position to an appropriated fund position.</p><p></p><p>I.  A U.S. Postal Service civilian employee transferred under 39 U.S.C. §1006, to a DoD Component.  For a DoD civilian employee transferring to the U.S. Postal Service, see par. 054805-B.</p><p></p><p>053702.  Dependent Eligibility</p><p></p><p>Dependent travel and transportation allowances are based on the civilian employee’s travel order and are subject to the requirements and restrictions in this Part.  The traveler must be a dependent on the PCS order’s effective transfer or appointment date for dependent travel and transportation allowances to be authorized.  These allowances are effective when the travel order is signed and authorized for actual travel performed.  Reimbursement is limited to what the cost would be for direct travel between the official origin and destination by a usually traveled route, unless otherwise authorized in the JTR (see par. 032602).  Table 5-66 specifies the circumstances when dependent travel and transportation allowances are authorized. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-66.  Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances for Civilian Employee Transfers</p><p>If a civilian employee…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>transfers to or within the CONUS for a PCS, </p><p>dependent travel and transportation allowances may be authorized. </p><p>2</p><p>transfers or is reassigned as a current civilian employee to or between PDSs OCONUS for a PCS,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>transfers or is reassigned as a current civilian employee from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS for a PCS,</p><p></p><p>4</p><p>returns from OCONUS for separation after completing the minimum service period or for other reasons acceptable to the Government,</p><p></p><p>5</p><p>is appointed or recruited OCONUS for assignment locally or to a different geographical location OCONUS, has a service agreement, and returns for separation after completing the agreed minimum service period, or for other reasons acceptable to the Government, </p><p></p><p>6</p><p>transfers for a first PDS,</p><p>dependent transportation allowances, but no per diem, may be authorized.  Travel to a first PDS is limited to the Government’s transportation cost from the actual residence at the time of appointment to the PDS by a usually traveled route.</p><p>7</p><p>divorces a spouse or permanently separates from a domestic partner and the former spouse or domestic partner traveled to the civilian employee’s PDS OCONUS as a dependent at Government expense,*</p><p>reimbursement for the former dependent’s return travel and transportation allowances to the actual residence is authorized anywhere in the world. </p><p>8</p><p>is serving OCONUS when his or her dependent turns age 21 and the dependent’s last travel OCONUS was at Government expense,</p><p>the dependent is authorized return travel to the civilian employee’s actual residence in the United States. </p><p>9</p><p>is eligible for return travel and an individual is no longer a dependent due to a divorce, annulment, or committed relationship termination,*</p><p>reimbursement for the former dependent’s return travel and transportation allowances is authorized to the actual residence. </p><p>10</p><p>serving OCONUS is assigned to a PDS within the CONUS,</p><p>a former dependent’s travel from OCONUS is authorized.  Return of a former dependent must be not later than when the civilian employee is subsequently eligible for travel or by the end of the current tour agreement and is contingent on authorized civilian employee travel to the United States except when travel is authorized under early return provisions in par. 053805. </p><p>11</p><p>serving OCONUS travels to the actual residence in the United States for separation,</p><p></p><p>12</p><p>serving OCONUS travels to the United States pursuant to a renewal agreement,</p><p></p><p>13</p><p>returns to the CONUS and a dependent chooses to remain in an area OCONUS,</p><p>payment of the constructed cost of any unused allowance must not be authorized. </p><p>14</p><p>violates a service agreement, or is not authorized return travel,</p><p>a dependent is also ineligible for Government-funded travel.</p><p>15</p><p>separates from a PDS in the same geographical location as the actual residence,</p><p>dependent travel costs are not reimbursable. </p><p>*Travel must begin before the end of the civilian employee’s current tour of duty.  If the civilian employee is serving under a 1-, 2-, or 3-year tour agreement, travel for a former dependent must begin before the end of the 1-, 2-, or 3-year tour during which the divorce, annulment, or committed relationship termination became final.  If the civilian employee is serving under an administrative tour extension, travel for a former dependent must begin before the end of the administrative extension in effect during which the divorce, annulment, or committed relationship termination became final.</p><p></p><p>A.  Dependent Age.  A dependent child’s eligibility for travel allowances depends on the child’s age (see Table 5-77) on the date the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS (B-160928, March 28, 1969, and B-166208, April 1, 1969) even if travel is delayed.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Allowances not Payable.  A civilian employee is not authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances when a dependent travels at personal expense before a PCS order is issued or before official notice is received that a PCS order is to be issued.  Transportation must not be furnished before a PCS order is issued.  If there are any other Government-funded travel and transportation allowances for this travel, no other allowances are authorized.  A civilian employee is not authorized dependent travel and transportation allowances when a dependent is a civilian employee’s or spouse’s parent, stepparent, or person in loco parentis (except in connection with an early return of a dependent) who does not reside in the civilian employee’s household, unless otherwise authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process. </p><p></p><p>1.  Dependent travel and transportation allowances are not authorized between points otherwise authorized in this Part to a place at which they do not intend to establish a permanent residence, including pleasure trips.</p><p></p><p>2.  Dependent travel to an area OCONUS is not authorized unless a minimum of 1 year remains on the civilian employee’s service agreement as of the dependent’s scheduled arrival date in the area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>053703.  Eligible Travel Locations for Dependent</p><p></p><p>A.  Dependent Travel Locations.  Table 5-67 specifies the authorized origins and destinations for dependent travel.</p><p>Table 5-67.  Dependent Travel Points of Origin and Destination*</p><p>A civilian employee…</p><p>Origin…</p><p>Destination…</p><p>1</p><p>transfers to or within the CONUS for a PCS</p><p>The civilian employee’s old PDS, or some other point (multiple dependents may start at separate locations).</p><p>The new PDS, some other point selected by the civilian employee, or both.</p><p>2</p><p>transfers or is reassigned to or between PDSs OCONUS for a PCS. </p><p>The civilian employee’s PDS, or some other place (multiple dependents may start at separate locations).</p><p>The PDS OCONUS or an alternate destination in the CONUS specified at the time of transfer.</p><p>3</p><p>transfers or is reassigned from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>The PDS in the CONUS or an alternate destination in the CONUS specified at the time of transfer.</p><p>4</p><p>recruited in the CONUS takes an initial appointment OCONUS. </p><p>The actual residence.</p><p>The PDS OCONUS or an alternate destination in the CONUS specified at the time of transfer.</p><p>5</p><p>recruited OCONUS takes an initial appointment OCONUS in a locality different from the actual residence. </p><p></p><p></p><p>6</p><p>is recruited locally OCONUS for an initial assignment and executes a service agreement, and the dependent is not already in the area OCONUS when employment begins.  </p><p></p><p></p><p>7</p><p>executes a renewal service agreement to serve an additional tour OCONUS, whether in the same or a different area, and is transferred or reassigned OCONUS, provided the dependent did not accompany the civilian employee to the area OCONUS on the preceding tour.</p><p>The PDS at the time of the initial transfer or reassignment OCONUS, or the actual residence if a civilian employee is a new appointee at the time of the original PCS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>8</p><p>returns from OCONUS for separation after completing the minimum service period or for other reasons acceptable to the Government. </p><p>The PDS OCONUS.</p><p>The actual residence established at the time of appointment or transfer to the PDS OCONUS or to an alternate destination anywhere in the world.</p><p>9</p><p>recruited OCONUS for an assignment at a PDS OCONUS in a different geographical location, who separates after completing the agreed service period or for other reasons acceptable to the Government. </p><p></p><p>The actual residence or to an alternate destination in the geographical location of the actual residence.</p><p>*Travel to any other point may be authorized, but is limited to the cost by the usual transportation mode by a usually traveled route between the normally authorized points (old PDS to new PDS).  Any excess costs are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Travel-Related Circumstances.  Dependent transportation is not payable for any part of the journey when a U.S. flag air carrier or ship is available and a foreign flag air carrier or ship is used.  However, per diem is still payable for that part of the journey.  When a foreign Government provides dependent transportation (whether it is used or not) at no cost to the United States or the civilian employee under a contract or agreement with the United States, reimbursement for dependent transportation allowances is not authorized, but per diem is still payable.</p><p></p><p>053704.  Dependent-Restricted Tour for Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee may be authorized transportation for a dependent and HHG at Government expense to an alternate location when, by proper command policy, dependents are not permitted to accompany a civilian employee to a PDS location because of adverse conditions (5 U.S.C. §5725).  An activity or area commander, in coordination with commanders of other service activities in an area and upon approval by the jurisdictional Headquarters command, may establish a policy precluding dependents from accompanying a civilian employee to a PDS OCONUS and restricting HHG movement to such location because of dangerous or adverse living conditions.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Alternate Destination Point.  When a civilian employee’s dependents are not allowed to accompany him or her to a PDS OCONUS to which the civilian employee is assigned or transferred, transportation of dependents and HHG may be authorized to an alternate destination designated by the civilian employee.  When it is impracticable to secure the civilian employee’s designation, transportation of dependents and HHG may be authorized to a destination designated by a dependent.</p><p></p><p>2.  Subsequent Transportation of Dependents and HHG.  The dependents and HHG may be moved later from the alternate point to the civilian employee’s PDS when the restriction is lifted or to an unrestricted PDS to which the civilian employee is subsequently assigned or transferred.</p><p></p><p>3.  Authorization Restrictions.  Except as otherwise provided in JTR, transportation of dependents and HHG to a PDS OCONUS is not authorized unless both of the following conditions apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  At least 1 year remains in the civilian employee’s tour of duty at that PDS on the date of scheduled arrival of the dependents at the civilian employee’s PDS. </p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee agrees to serve for 1 year after arrival of dependents at the OCONUS PDS or the transportation is authorized through the Secretarial Process.</p><p></p><p>053705.  Government Interest </p><p></p><p>A.  Determining Factors.  PCS travel and transportation allowances must be paid when it is in the Government’s interest to fill a position by moving a civilian employee from one PDS to another.  Case-by-case factors, such as cost-effectiveness, labor market conditions, and difficulty in filling the vacancy, form the basis for determining whether to offer PCS allowances.  Budget constraints do not justify denying PCS allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Responsibilities.  It is each DoD Component’s responsibility to make decisions that balance a civilian employee’s rights and the prudent use of appropriated funds.  Before a DoD Component advertises for a vacancy, the appropriate official should determine if it is in the Government’s interest to pay PCS allowances taking case-by-case factors into consideration.  For example, an activity may determine that well-qualified candidates exist within a particular geographical area and restrict the recruitment area in the recruitment announcement or indicate that PCS allowances are not offered.  This information should be provided in the position advertisement, but can be decided after the applicants are referred to the selecting official.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reason for Move.  The guidelines for making a move in the Government’s best interest are as follows: </p><p></p><p>1.  Management-directed Moves in the Government’s interest.  A PCS is in the Government’s best interest when a DoD Component recruits or requests a civilian employee to transfer.  This is limited to relocation for a RIF, a transfer of function, a DoD Component career-development program, a DoD Component-directed placement, or another reason that the transfer is in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>2.  PCS Moves not in the Government’s Interest.  If a civilian employee pursues, solicits, or requests a position change resulting in a geographic move from one PDS to another, the transfer is for the civilian employee’s convenience and benefit, not in the Government’s interest.  In that case, the gaining activity must formally advise the civilian employee, at the time it extends an offer, that the transfer is in the civilian employee’s interest, not in the Government’s interest, and that the Government does not pay the PCS expenses.  A civilian employee responding to a vacancy request is not pursuing, soliciting, or requesting a position change.</p><p></p><p>D.  Notification.  Travel and transportation allowances do not tie automatically to a Merit Promotion Program vacancy announcement.  The appropriate official must document any decision against paying PCS allowances in writing.  The organization must notify in writing all applicants selected for interview of its decision whether to pay PCS allowances.  If the organization does not hold interviews, it must inform the selected applicant, in writing, whether it will pay PCS allowances. </p><p>053706.  PCS Limitation Policy</p><p></p><p>A.  Move Frequency.  It is neither cost effective nor efficient to provide more than one PCS move to a DoD civilian employee during any 12-month period.  A transfer within the DoD at Government expense may not be authorized within 12 months of the civilian employee’s most recent PCS unless the AO certifies that the proposed transfer is in the Government’s interest, an equally qualified civilian employee is not available within the commuting area of the activity concerned, and the losing activity agrees to the transfer.  This policy does not preclude a civilian employee from accepting a position, but it may cause the civilian employee to relocate at personal expense.  The following moves are exceptions to the 12-month period limitation: </p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee or re-employed former civilian employee affected by a RIF or transfer of functions (see par. 054805).</p><p></p><p>2.  A DoD Component directed placement.</p><p></p><p>3.  From the actual residence to a new PDS, after the civilian employee exercises return transportation rights from a PDS OCONUS under a tour agreement OCONUS, but only if the civilian employee did not receive PCS allowances for the return to actual residence.  A civilian employee who signed a new service agreement for return to actual residence and received TQSE or MEA reimbursements has received PCS allowances.</p><p></p><p></p><p>B.  Successive PCS Moves.  When a civilian employee makes successive PCS moves and dependent or HHG movement is delayed until transfer to the last PDS, movement is allowed by the direct route between the first and last PDSs, provided the 1-year time limitation under the authority for the first transfer has not expired.  If the 1-year time limitation has expired for transfer from the first PDS, travel and transportation allowances are limited to those from a subsequent PDS where the 1-year time limitation has not expired to the last PDS.  See par. 053713 for funding responsibility. </p><p></p><p>053707.  Two or More Family Members Are Civilian Employees (FTR §302-3)</p><p></p><p>When two or more civilian employees who are members of the same immediate family are transferred in the Government’s interest, they may either choose to receive the travel and transportation allowances each separately or one as a civilian employee and the other as a dependent.  All affected civilian employees must sign a written document outlining the choice.  If each civilian employee chooses to receive travel and transportation allowances as a civilian employee, neither is treated as the other’s dependent.  Otherwise, one civilian employee is eligible for travel and transportation allowances on behalf of the other as a dependent.  When a civilian employee chooses separate travel and transportation allowances, duplicate benefits must not be paid to both civilian employees on behalf of a non-civilian employee dependent.  When a civilian employee chooses separate benefits, the written document must specify which civilian employee receives the allowances for a non-civilian employee dependent. </p><p></p><p>053708.  Civilian Employee Married to Service Member</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee is authorized PCS allowances when transferred in the Government’s interest, even if the civilian employee’s Service member spouse is also transferred at the same time to the same place.  The couple may not each receive PCS travel and transportation allowance payments for the same purpose or expense.  Duplicate payments are not allowed.</p><p></p><p>053709.  Permanent Duty Tour (PDT) Counseling</p><p></p><p>Each DoD Component must provide counseling on travel, transportation and other relocation allowances to all civilian employees before PCS.  Counseling assists a civilian employee in making more-informed decisions, allowing him or her to play a more active role in the PCS, and educates a civilian employee of the options when selling or buying a residence due to the enormous financial implications.  Either the DoD Component or contractors may provide counseling.  This counseling should be offered as early as possible during the PCS process and may be offered to a selected candidate who is contemplating acceptance of a job that would require relocation.  </p><p></p><p>053710.  Reassignment or Transfer Advance Notice</p><p></p><p>The civilian employee should be given at least 30 days notice before reporting to a new PDS or DoD Component outside the commuting area to allow him or her adequate time to prepare for the transfer or reassignment.  The notice period should not be less than 30 days except when any of the following occur:</p><p></p><p>A.  The civilian employee and both the losing and gaining Agencies agree on a shorter period.</p><p></p><p>B.  Other statutory authority and implementing regulations stipulate a shorter period (OPM regulations for specified time frames).</p><p></p><p>C.  There are emergency circumstances.</p><p>053711.  Reimbursement and Timing</p><p></p><p>The reimbursement maximums and limitations that apply to certain allowances are not the same for every civilian employee, even though claims may be filed within the same period, due to successive changes to these regulations governing PCS allowances, and the extended period that a civilian employee retains eligibility for certain allowances (see par. 053712).  The regulations in effect on the appointee’s or civilian employee’s appointment or transfer effective date apply for payment and reimbursement purposes.</p><p></p><p>053712.  Time Limits for Using PCS Allowances</p><p></p><p>All travel between authorized points in the travel order should be accomplished as soon as possible.  All authorized PCS allowances must be used and completed within 1 year from the effective transfer or appointment date.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for PCS travel and transportation allowances beyond the initial 1 year unless an extension is authorized or approved by the DoD Component as being in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>A.  Extension.  The DoD Component may grant an extension, upon a civilian employee’s request, only if the 1-year time limit for purchase or sale of a residence or an unexpired lease transaction was completed under par. 054501-B.  Reasons that do not justify authorizing or approving an extension include, but are not limited to, delaying a dependent or HHG relocation in anticipation of a future PCS order not yet issued and residence construction or renovation delays at the new PDS.  When an extension is authorized or approved, PCS allowances must be calculated by using the regulations and rates in effect on the civilian employee’s transfer effective date.</p><p></p><p>B.  Embargoes or Shipping Restrictions.  When a civilian employee is assigned to duty OCONUS and travel and transportation is not feasible due to shipping restrictions, that time does not count toward the 1-year time limit.  The delay required by travel restriction and administrative embargo that make dependent travel impossible is excluded from the 1-year period.  Lack of family housing in an area OCONUS that prevents dependent travel is an administrative embargo.  When an administrative embargo is removed, the command OCONUS must notify in writing each affected civilian employee.  The remaining number of days left in the 1-year time limit when travel was impeded are all that remain allowing execution of travel and transportation allowances on the date when the embargo is removed.</p><p></p><p>C.  Military Duty.  For a civilian employee who enters active military duty any time before the 1-year period ends, the time spent in military service is not included in the period.  The 1-year period excludes furlough time spent by a civilian employee who begins active military service before the expiration of the 1-year period and who is furloughed for the military assignment duration to the PDS for which transportation and travel expenses are allowed.</p><p></p><p>D.  Transfers without a Break in Service.  When a civilian employee of another Federal Department or Agency stationed OCONUS is transferred to a position in a DoD activity OCONUS without a break in service, dependent travel from the old PDS OCONUS to the new PDS OCONUS is authorized if the move is in the Government’s best interest.  If the civilian employee’s dependent has not joined the civilian employee in the area OCONUS, travel from the last PDS or actual residence may be authorized subject to the 1-year time limit.  This applies whether the actual residence is in the United States or another country.</p><p></p><p>E.  Locally Hired Civilian Employee.  The time limit applies to dependent travel of any civilian employee hired locally in a foreign location who executes a service agreement at the time of original appointment or who enters into a renewal agreement for an additional tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>F.  Dependent Travel Delay and Return for Separation.  When a civilian employee returns to the CONUS from a PDS OCONUS for separation, dependent travel may be delayed if the activity’s commanding officer OCONUS authorizes or approves the delay.  The civilian employee must submit a written request for delayed travel.  Costs for unauthorized delays are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>053713.  Travel and Transportation Funding (FTR §302-2)</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee’s pay and leave status during official travel are subject to the separate Departments’ regulations about hours of duty, pay, and leave.  A new appointee is in a duty status while traveling to the first PDS.  For regulations governing excused absence and duty status while preparing for and completing a PCS move, see DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 630 (civilian employee leave).</p><p></p><p>A.  Movement between Different Departments and Agencies or DoD Components.  This applies to movement between any of the following: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, DoD Components, and to or from non-DoD Agencies.  Except in the case of a RIF, transfer of function, or movement under the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP), costs associated with a PCS may be paid by the gaining Department, Agency, or DoD Component. </p><p></p><p>1.  RIF or Transfer of Function.  The losing activity must pay transfer costs between different DoD activities of a civilian employee identified for separation or demotion caused by RIF or transfer of function.  A losing DoD activity must request that the non-DoD gaining activity pay or share the costs for transfers that involve a RIF or transfer of function to a Department or Agency outside DoD.  If a non-DoD gaining activity refuses to assume or share the expense, the losing activity must pay the cost.</p><p></p><p>2.  PPP.  PCS costs for movement under the PPP to a different DoD Component, due to a RIF or transfer of function, are funded the same as for any other RIF or transfer of function.  When a RIF or transfer of function is not involved and a civilian employee returns to the United States through the PPP from a foreign area assignment the gaining activity pays TQSE and MEA.  The losing activity pays other PCS costs.</p><p></p><p>B.  Movement within the Same DoD Component.  The gaining activity may pay PCS movement costs if the move meets the criteria in par. 053701, except in the following cases: RIF or transfer of function, base realignment and closure (BRAC), from an activity OCONUS to an activity in the CONUS, or from an activity OCONUS to an activity of the same DoD Component in Hawaii.</p><p></p><p>1.  RIF or Transfer of Function.  The losing activity must pay movement costs.</p><p></p><p>2.  BRAC.  Ordinarily the gaining activity pays PCS movement costs.  However, the losing activity may, at its discretion, pay PCS movement costs due to a BRAC action.</p><p></p><p>3.  Transfer from an Activity OCONUS to an Activity in the CONUS.  When a civilian employee transfers from a PDS activity OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS, the losing activity must pay travel and transportation allowances for the civilian employee and dependent according to par. 054804-A.  This includes transportation and per diem for the civilian employee and dependent transportation, HHG, and POV transportation to the civilian employee’s actual residence or activity in the CONUS, limited to what it would cost to travel to the civilian employee’s actual residence.  If the gaining activity authorizes PCS allowances, it is responsible for additional civilian employee and dependent transportation and per diem costs, and transportation of HHG and a POV to the new PDS, plus MEA, RIT and, if the civilian employee is eligible, real estate allowances.  At the gaining activity’s discretion, the activity may pay for TQSE and an HHT, if the civilian employee is eligible, for any of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  A civilian employee who completes his or her tour of duty under the current service agreement.</p><p></p><p>b.  A civilian employee released from the period of service specified in the service agreement for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the losing DoD Component.</p><p></p><p>c.  An Army civilian employee moved under the civilian Career Management Program referral system who completes an initial tour of duty OCONUS and at least half of an additional tour greater than 12 months or two-thirds of an additional 12-month tour.</p><p></p><p>d.  A civilian employee with or without a service agreement moved under the PPP.  If a RIF or transfer of function is involved, the losing activity must pay movement costs.</p><p></p><p>4.  Transfer from an Activity OCONUS to an Activity of the Same DoD Component in Hawaii.  Funding travel and transportation for a civilian employee who transfers from an activity OCONUS to a Hawaiian activity of the same DoD Component is the same as any other activity moving due to a RIF or transfer of function, a BRAC, or from an activity OCONUS to an activity in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>5.  Directed Transfer due to Failure to Complete Probationary Period.  The losing activity must pay authorized transfer costs when a civilian employee fails to complete a probationary period satisfactorily.</p><p></p><p>6.  Civilian Employee Returning from Foreign Area through the PPP.  The losing activity must pay travel and transportation costs for a civilian employee returning through the PPP from foreign area assignment in the same DoD Component when a RIF or transfer of functions is not involved.  The gaining activity must pay TQSE and MEA.</p><p></p><p>C.  Separation from Employment OCONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  Separation after Travel Begins.  The losing activity must pay the en route travel and transportation costs for a civilian employee, eligible for transportation under a service agreement, who returns to the actual residence or alternate destination.  This is limited to the travel and transportation costs to the actual residence for separation from the losing PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Separation before Travel Begins.  When a civilian employee, eligible for travel and transportation to the actual residence, resigns OCONUS before beginning travel from the PDS OCONUS, the eligibility continues and the losing activity OCONUS must pay the movement expenses to the actual residence.  When a civilian employee under those same conditions expects to continue in Government service in a different Department or Agency in the actual residence locality, and is not employed by, or authorized PCS allowances by, the gaining activity before departure from the losing PDS OCONUS, the losing activity OCONUS must pay the movement expenses to the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>3.  Employment after Separating (without a Break in Service) from the Losing Activity.  When a civilian employee under an agreement returns to the actual residence or allowable alternate destination in the United States for separation, and, after arrival at the destination, is employed by another DoD Component without a break in service, the losing activity OCONUS must pay for the allowable separation limited to travel and transportation costs to the actual residence.  For the requirements and limitations regarding payment by the gaining DoD Component when additional travel and transportation to the new PDS is necessary and circumstances under which PCS allowances may be authorized and paid, see par. 054804-B.</p><p></p><p>4.  Separation Due to Civilian Employee Transfer between Activities OCONUS.  When a civilian employee, under an agreement at an activity OCONUS, is transferred to a different activity OCONUS at the same or a different PDS, the gaining activity is responsible for the civilian employee’s separation travel cost if the civilian employee is or becomes eligible for separation travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>053714.  Temporary Change of Station (TCS) (FTR §302-3)</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  An AO may authorize a TCS with limited PCS allowances, instead of TDY allowances, for a civilian employee scheduled for a long-term TDY not less than 6 months or more than 30 months.  An AO may authorize a TCS only when it is expected to last 6 months or more.  The TCS location is the civilian employee’s temporary official duty location.  If the assignment ends sooner than 6 months, for reasons other than separation from Government service, TCS expenses are paid.  If the assignment is more than 30 months, the civilian employee must be permanently assigned to the temporary official location or returned to the previous official location.  A TCS assignment may be considered only if the civilian employee is directed to perform a long-term TDY at another duty location outside the local area as defined in section 0206.  No minimum distance between a PDS and TCS location is required to qualify for a TCS.  A Service agreement is not required for a TCS move.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Ineligible Civilian Employees.  The following are ineligible for a TCS assignment:</p><p></p><p>1.  A new appointee.</p><p></p><p>2.  An individual employed intermittently in the Government service as a consultant or expert and paid on a daily “when actually employed” basis.</p><p></p><p>3.  An individual serving without pay or at $1 a year.</p><p></p><p>4.  A civilian employee assigned under the Government Civilian Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. §4109).</p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee assigned to or from a state or local government under the Inter-Governmental Personnel Act (5 U.S.C. §3372) (see par. 053715).</p><p></p><p>C.  AO Considerations.  The AO must determine that TCS is more advantageous than a TDY or PCS, otherwise TDY travel and per diem are payable.</p><p></p><p>1.  Component Cost Considerations.  An AO should consider a TCS when a cost comparison shows that a TCS is to the Government’s advantage.  The AO should compare the costs for a long-term TDY with per diem and actual expense allowance (AEA) for the entire period of the assignment and the costs for a TCS, which has substantial relocation allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment and less substantial payments for extended storage and property management services, if authorized.</p><p></p><p>2.  Civilian Employee Tax Consideration.  An AO should consider TCS when a long-term TDY results in a non-reimbursable income tax liability for a civilian employee.  A civilian employee who performs a TCS is subject to income tax on some of the TCS reimbursements, and receives a RIT allowance.  A civilian employee who performs a TDY for more than 1 year at a single location is subject to income tax on travel reimbursements.  A traveler should contact Federal, state, and local authorities concerning potential income tax liability. </p><p></p><p>3.  Civilian Employee Concerns.  An AO should consider the possible negative effect of a long-term absence from the PDS and immediate family on the civilian employee’s morale and job performance, and other civilian employee pay, such as locality pay and non-foreign cost of living allowances. </p><p></p><p>4.  Equity Concerns.  An AO should consider the financial inequity that results when a civilian employee on a long-term TDY lives in a manner similar to a permanently assigned civilian employee while receiving TDY allowances.</p><p></p><p>D.  TCS Allowances</p><p></p><p>Table 5-68.  Allowances Authorized and not Authorized</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.  Civilian employee’s travel and transportation expenses (see par. 053901-A for per diem).</p><p>b.  Transportation and dependent per diem.</p><p>c.  POV transportation.</p><p>d.  MALT, if a POV is used.</p><p>e.  HHG transportation and SIT.</p><p>f.  Mobile home transportation instead of HHG transportation.</p><p>g.  Storage of a POV for support of contingency operations only.</p><p>h.  MEA.</p><p>i.  RIT allowance (see par. 053611).</p><p>2</p><p>Not Authorized</p><p>a.  TDY travel allowances, including TDY per diem.*</p><p>b.  AEA.</p><p>c.  TDY transportation allowances.</p><p>d.  Non-emergency storage of a POV.</p><p>*If a TCS is authorized, a civilian employee may not choose payment of per diem expenses instead of a TCS.</p><p></p><p>1.  Discretionary Allowances.  A civilian employee may be authorized an HHT, TQSE while occupying temporary lodging, NTS of HHG when necessary during the assignment, and property management services at the civilian employee’s old PDS residence for the TCS duration.</p><p></p><p>a.  HHG.  The AO determines the storage location of authorized NTS of HHG, which may be stored for the TCS duration.  Together, the total weight of HHG stored and the weight of HHG transported must not be greater than the maximum 18,000 pounds.  The civilian employee is personally financially responsible for all excess costs if the total weight of stored and transported HHG is greater than the maximum allowed.</p><p></p><p>b.  Property Management Services.  Property management services may be authorized only for a residence at the civilian employee’s PDS in the CONUS or a non-foreign PDS OCONUS from which the civilian employee was assigned to the TCS location. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances upon Assignment Completion.  When returning to the original PDS, a civilian employee is authorized all of the allowances in par. 053714-C1 and Table-5-69 except property management services and an HHT.  The civilian employee may not be paid for extended storage or property management services incurred after the last day of the 30th month or the expiration of the order, whichever occurs first.  He or she must be paid for the expenses of returning the civilian employee, immediate family, and HHG to the previous official location unless he or she is permanently assigned to the temporary official location.</p><p></p><p>E.  Temporary Official Station Becomes the PDS.  TCS allowances stop on the day the TCS location becomes the PDS.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-69.  Allowances Payable when the TDY Station becomes the PDS</p><p>1</p><p>Payable</p><p>a.  Travel, including per diem for the civilian employee and dependents who relocated to the TCS location for one round trip between the TCS location and old PDS.</p><p>b.  Transportation and per diem for one-way travel from the old PDS for those dependents not previously relocated to the TCS location.</p><p>c.  Transportation of POVs not previously transported, if authorized, for a TCS being converted to a PCS between locations in the CONUS.*</p><p>d.  Real estate expenses.</p><p>e.  Residence-related relocation service expenses may be authorized.*</p><p>f.  Property management expenses may be authorized.*</p><p>g.  Transportation of HHG not previously transported to the TCS location, limited to maximum weight.</p><p>h.  Short-distance HHG move if the residence at the new PDS changes.</p><p>i.  TQSE while occupying temporary lodging may be authorized in extraordinary circumstances.*</p><p>2</p><p>Not Payable</p><p>a.  An HHT to the temporary official station.</p><p>b.  TDY per diem.</p><p>c.  Transaction expenses for selling a residence or breaking a lease at the TCS location.</p><p>*These allowances are discretionary.</p><p></p><p>F.  TCS and Separation from Government Service</p><p></p><p>1.  After TCS Completion.  A civilian employee who separates, by either retiring or resigning, from Government service after TCS completion is authorized the same PCS expenses had the civilian employee not separated from Government service.  If the civilian employee returns to a location other than the PDS or remains at the TCS location, PCS allowances are authorized, limited to the amount that would have been paid if the civilian employee had returned to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Before TCS Completion.  If a civilian employee separates from Government service before TCS completion for reasons that are both beyond his or her control and acceptable to the Service or Agency, the civilian employee is authorized the same PCS expenses had he or she not separated.  Otherwise, payments are limited to what would have been payable had the TCS been performed as a TDY.</p><p>053715.  Inter-Governmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Program </p><p>OPM maintains oversight of the IPA Mobility Program.  Assignments solely for training are not made using this authority.  5 U.S.C. §3371-§3375 (IPA), provide authority for the temporary assignment of a civilian employee between the Federal Government and state or local government, institutions of higher education, Indian tribal governments, federally funded research and development centers, or other eligible organizations.  Travel and transportation under the IPA Mobility Program must follow 5 CFR §334.</p><p>A.  Eligibility.  When a civilian employee is assigned between the Federal Government and a state or local government or institution of higher education authorized by the IPA Mobility Program, travel expenses or limited relocation expenses may be authorized.  The civilian employee must sign a written service agreement for 1 year or for the length of the assignment, whichever is shorter, to be eligible for payment of per diem at the assignment location or limited relocation expenses.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The standard allowances for round-trip travel, transportation, and per diem may be authorized as specified in Chapter 2 or the AO may authorize the following PCS allowances for relocation:</p><p></p><p>1.  Civilian employee and dependent travel and transportation expenses to and from the assignment location.</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation and SIT expenses of the civilian employee’s HHG and personal items.</p><p></p><p>3.  TQSE when the assignment starts and when it is completed.</p><p></p><p>4.  An MEA.</p><p></p><p>5.  Civilian employee expenses for NTS of HHG and personal items, when the civilian employee is assigned to an isolated location in par. 054807.</p><p></p><p>C.  Time Limitation.  An assignment may be up to 2 years long; intermittent, part time, or full time; extended for up to an additional 2 years when beneficial to both organizations; and terminated at any time.</p><p></p><p>0538  CIVILIAN PCS TRANSPORTATION</p><p></p><p>053801.  Airplane, Train, Ship, and Bus Transportation</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee and any dependents must use an available TMC for PDT.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Commercial.  Reimbursement of personally procured transportation is limited to the policy-constructed airfare that the Government would have paid had the civilian employee or dependent purchased the ticket through the TMC for authorized transportation over a usually traveled direct route according to a schedule that meets the PCS order’s requirements.  When air travel is medically inadvisable for the civilian employee or an accompanying dependent for transoceanic travel, reimbursement is limited to the least costly available first-class passenger accommodations on a commercial ship. </p><p></p><p>B.  Government.  An AO may direct a civilian employee or a dependent to use Government transportation.  A civilian employee or dependent who uses a transportation mode other than the mode directed is not reimbursed for transportation costs. </p><p></p><p>C.  Air Travel Medically Inadvisable.  When air travel is medically inadvisable for transoceanic travel for a family member, the family should not be separated unless the family agrees to be.  A condition that makes air travel medically inadvisable is not limited to physical disability.  If a civilian employee or dependent has a bona fide fear or aversion to flying, to the extent that serious psychological or physical reaction would result, this may be a basis for the issuance of a medical certificate precluding aircraft travel.  A medical authority must certify the condition and the AO must authorize it in advance of travel.  The civilian employee and the AO must each receive a copy of the written medical determination.  When air travel is medically inadvisable, surface transportation provided must be the least costly commercial ship passenger accommodations.  See Chapters 2 and 3 for the required accommodations, use of U.S. flag ships, and travel by oceangoing car ferry. </p><p></p><p>053802.  Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee or dependent who uses a POV may be authorized MALT.  MALT is based on the official distance in par. 020204, when traveling on a PCS order between any of the official points in Table 2-2.  A rental car used for PCS travel is considered a POV.  Use the actual amount, without rounding, when computing MALT.  The MALT rate in effect on the date PCS travel commences applies even if travel is completed after the rate changes.  See Chapter 2 for POV use to or from a transportation terminal or PDS, or miscellaneous reimbursable expenses associated with POV transportation.</p><p></p><p>A.  Automobile Use.  Automobile use is to the government’s advantage for first duty station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel.  Automobile use by a dependent is to the Government’s advantage for PCS travel, other than transoceanic. </p><p></p><p>B.  Privately Owned Motorcycle.  The use of a privately owned motorcycle for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government’s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation.  Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day.</p><p></p><p>C.  Privately Owned Airplane</p><p></p><p>1.  The use of a privately owned airplane for first duty-station travel by a newly recruited civilian employee or appointee, PCS travel, or separation travel, is to the Government’s advantage when travel costs, including associated per diem, are less than commercial transportation.  Compare travel costs at the applicable MALT rate, plus per diem for the travel period, limited to the time required to complete the trip at a rate of 350 miles a calendar day.</p><p></p><p>2.  Nautical miles must be converted to statute miles.  One nautical mile equals 1.15077945 statute miles, so that 250 nautical miles multiplied by 1.15077945 equals 288 statute miles.</p><p></p><p>3.  Reimbursement for travel by privately owned airplane is at the appropriate TDY mileage rate. </p><p></p><p>D.  Privately Owned Aircraft Other than Airplane.  The actual operation cost is reimbursed instead of a commuted rate mileage.  The following expenses are reimbursable: fuel, oil, and aircraft parking, landing, and tie-down fees.  The following expenses are not reimbursable: charges for repairs, depreciation, replacements, grease, oil change, antifreeze, towage, and similar expenses.</p><p></p><p>E.  Transoceanic Travel by POV.  An AO may authorize a civilian employee or dependent to use a POV on a route normally involving transoceanic travel if it is more advantageous to the Government.  This provision only applies when the POV is used for the entire distance between duty locations, for the official distance rather than the actual distance.  This applies regardless of whether reimbursement is more than other transportation modes.  A civilian or dependent who travels by privately owned boat may be reimbursed the actual cost for fuel, oil, and docking fees limited to the policy-constructed airfare. </p><p></p><p>F.  Multiple Travelers.  When more than one traveler on official orders uses the same POV, only one traveler may receive reimbursement for MALT and POV-related reimbursable expenses.  All other travelers in the same vehicle are passengers and receive no transportation reimbursement.</p><p></p><p>1.

The number of family members, including their luggage, cannot be transported in two vehicles.</p><p>b.  A dependent requires special accommodations due to age or physical conditions and two POVs are required for other family members.</p><p>c.  A civilian employee must report to the new PDS before the dependents; the delayed travel is for reasons acceptable to the AO, such as school-term completion or personal business-affairs settlement; and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p>d.  The dependents perform unaccompanied travel between authorized points other than those that the civilian employee uses, such as travel to a designated place or to the new PDS while the civilian employee has TDY en route, and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p>e.  The dependents perform unaccompanied travel to the new PDS before the civilian employee’s reporting date for reasons acceptable to the AO, such as to enroll dependents in school at the beginning of the term, and there are more dependents than can reasonably fit together with luggage in a single POV.</p><p></p><p>053803.  Mixed-Mode Travel</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee may be authorized reimbursement limited to the MALT rate plus per diem for the authorized travel.  When POV use is authorized for all PDT travel, and the civilian employee instead uses both POV and another mode, he or she is authorized the MALT rate for the distance traveled by POV, costs incurred for commercial transportation, and per diem for actual travel time.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>053804.  PCS To, From, or Between Points OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A.  General.  A civilian employee traveling on a PCS order to, from, or between points OCONUS is authorized the applicable allowances in this section for the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  The official distance between the old PDS and the appropriate port of embarkation serving the old PDS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation by available Government aircraft or ship, or Government-procured transportation or reimbursement for costs incurred for personally procured transportation for the transoceanic travel involved plus applicable per diem.</p><p></p><p>3.  The official distance between the appropriate port of debarkation that serves the new PDS and the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>4.  Travel to and from the vehicle processing centers (VPC), when concurrent with the en route travel.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transoceanic Travel.  When transoceanic travel is involved between to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS, air transportation is the normally authorized transportation mode for transoceanic travel for both the civilian employee and any dependents.  For POV travel, see par. 053802-E.  A dependent is required to use Government transportation when it is reasonably available and directed.  However, the dependent must not be required to use other than regularly scheduled transport type aircraft, such as Patriot Express or Category B AMC transportation, ordinarily used for passenger service.  When appropriate Government air transportation is available and travel by aircraft has not been determined medically inadvisable but a dependent travels at personal expense no reimbursement is authorized. </p><p></p><p>C.  Concurrent Travel.  Concurrent dependent travel from the CONUS is authorized to specific areas OCONUS (see Table 5-67).  For a civilian employee on a PCS order to a dependent-restricted tour, see par. 053704.  When prior command approval OCONUS is necessary, the recruiting office in the CONUS or other appropriate office must obtain concurrent travel authority from the command OCONUS and advise the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee.  When dependent travel is authorized concurrently with the civilian employee or within 60 days after the civilian employee’s reporting date at the Army, Navy, or Air Force transportation terminal in the CONUS, the activity responsible for processing the civilian employee must take action regarding the dependent’s passport, visas, immunizations or inoculations, port calls, and transportation.  When dependent travel, initially prohibited, is authorized by the command OCONUS subsequent to the civilian employee’s arrival at the PDS OCONUS, the civilian employee’s travel order must be amended to note the authority for dependent travel at that time.  </p><p></p><p>Note:  Follow the procedures in AR 55-46 (Travel Overseas) according to the priority system for an Army civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>D.  Indirect Travel.  When a civilian employee, at personal expense and convenience, performs PCS travel OCONUS over an indirect route, he or she is authorized reimbursement limited to the amount authorized for the direct route between the old PDS and new PDS.  The civilian employee is authorized all of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  Lodging plus per diem for land travel performed from the time the civilian employee departs the old PDS until the civilian employee reports to the new PDS.</p><p>2.  Reimbursement for the cost of transoceanic U.S. flag transportation used and per diem.</p><p></p><p>3.  Reimbursement for transoceanic, non-U.S. flag transportation used and per diem limited to the cost the Government would have incurred for the civilian employee’s transportation on the direct route if travel by non-U.S. flag carrier.  The indirect route is supported by the documentation required in Chapter 2 stating that a U.S. flag carrier was not available on either the direct route or the indirect route. </p><p></p><p>053805.  Early Return of a Dependent (ERD)</p><p></p><p>The appropriate command OCONUS may authorize a dependent’s return travel to the United States before a civilian employee’s return to the actual residence or travel to an alternate destination when in the Government’s best interest.  Early return travel may be authorized when a civilian employee is eligible for return transportation after completing the PDS service agreement, under exceptions to the PDS service period agreement, or if the command OCONUS determines that it is in the Government’s interest to return the dependent for humanitarian or compassionate reasons.  Reimbursement is limited to the Government’s cost for the usual transportation mode and route that the dependent would have used had he or she traveled back to the PDS OCONUS with the civilian employee.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for costs that are more than the most economical route from the PDS OCONUS to the civilian employee’s actual residence.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-71.  Rules for an Early Return of a Civilian Employee’s Dependent</p><p>If …</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>Government transportation is available,</p><p>the dependent must use Government transportation for ERD travel. </p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee completes a service agreement, has received unaccompanied one-way dependent transportation to the actual residence, and has RAT at a later date,</p><p>ERD transportation expenses to the PDS OCONUS are reimbursable.</p><p>3</p><p>a civilian employee’s dependent returns before the civilian employee is eligible for return travel and is not already authorized early return travel,</p><p>transportation expenses are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility</p><p>4</p><p>a civilian employee is eligible for return travel reimbursement,</p><p>travel expenses are limited to the cost of the dependent travel by the most economical route from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence and the amount allowable for the available transportation mode that would have been used when the civilian employee was eligible for return travel.  The most economical route includes the policy-constructed airfare when City Pair Program airfares are unavailable. </p><p>5</p><p>ERD travel was already authorized once during the period of service OCONUS,</p><p>further ERD travel must not be authorized. </p><p>6</p><p>ERD is performed at Government expense, </p><p>a dependent’s return travel at Government expense to the PDS OCONUS is not authorized except when due to RAT.</p><p>7</p><p>ERD travel is for RAT,</p><p>a dependent’s return travel may be authorized at Government expense to the PDS OCONUS. </p><p>8</p><p>an individual is no longer a dependent when the civilian employee is eligible for return travel due to divorce, annulment, or termination of a committed relationship,*</p><p>reimbursement for return travel and transportation allowances to the actual residence is authorized anywhere in the world for a civilian employee’s former spouse, domestic partner, or former dependent who traveled to the civilian employee’s PDS OCONUS as a dependent at Government expense.</p><p>*Travel must begin before the end of the civilian employee’s current tour of duty and before the end of the tour during which the divorce, annulment, or committed relationship termination became final, or before the end of an already approved administrative tour extension.</p><p>053806.  Dependent Student Travel</p><p></p><p>DoDI 1400.25, Vol. 1250.4.b (Civilian Employee Overseas Allowances and Differentials) authorizes educational travel, as specified in the DSSR §280, for a dependent student of a DoD civilian employee assigned in a foreign area for travel to and from a school offering a full-time course of secondary or post-secondary education.  Travel allowances for the dependent student’s secondary education are instead of an education allowance.  This travel is administered in accordance with DoD and Service regulations.</p><p></p><p>053807.  Authorized Travel Time</p><p></p><p>A.  Travel Time Rules.  A civilian employee or dependent is authorized travel time to complete a PDT move.  There is no mandatory distance that must be driven each day.</p><p></p><p>1.  If ordered to travel 400 or fewer miles between official points using a POV or Government automobile, then 1 day of travel is authorized for the official distance.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the distance is greater than 400 miles, then divide by 350 to determine the number of authorized travel days.  If the remainder is 51 or more, 1 additional travel day is allowed.  The result determines the maximum number of authorized travel days.  </p><p></p><p>Table 5-72.  Authorized Travel Time Rules for Civilian PDT</p><p>If a civilian employee…</p><p>Then authorized travel time is…</p><p>1</p><p>travels by Government or Government-procured airplane, train, ship, or bus, </p><p>the actual time needed to travel over the direct route, including necessary delays.</p><p>2</p><p>uses a POV not authorized by the AO as being to the Government’s advantage,</p><p>limited to that authorized for Government-procured transportation for the official ordered travel distance.</p><p>3</p><p>travels by a transportation mode other than the one authorized,</p><p>the actual travel time used, limited to the travel time for the authorized transportation mode.</p><p>4</p><p>spends less time traveling and the authorized travel time from the departure date through the arrival date,</p><p>the actual travel time (called the elapsed time).</p><p></p><p>B.  Mixed-Mode Travel Time.  Regardless of the number of transportation modes used, authorized travel time is limited to that allowed as if a POV were used for the entire travel, unless additional travel time is authorized.</p><p></p><p>1.  The authorized travel time when transportation is by mixed modes is computed using the total distance traveled by POV in whole days, limited to the travel time authorized for the official distance between the origin and destination, plus 1 day for commercial transportation other than transoceanic.</p><p></p><p>2.  Compute authorized mixed-mode travel time in Table 5-73.  The distance traveled to leave points is considered when computing travel time.  When computing the authorized travel time, do not include travel while at the leave point, old PDS, new PDS, or TDY location, or when traveling from a leave point and returning to the same leave point.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-73.  Computation for Mixed-Mode Travel</p><p>1</p><p>Determine the official distance between the authorized separate legs of the journey in par. 020205.</p><p>a.  If the distance is 400 or fewer miles, 1 day of travel is allowed.</p><p>b.  If the distance is greater than 400 miles, then divide by 350 to determine the number of authorized travel days.</p><p>c.  If the remainder is 51 or more, 1 additional travel day is authorized.  The result determines the maximum number of authorized travel days.</p><p>2</p><p>Determine the actual number of miles a POV was used between the official points (the distance traveled to a leave point is included).</p><p>a.  If this is greater than the official distance in Step 1, then the authorized travel is the same as in Step 1 and no further computation is required. </p><p>b.  If the distance is less than what was allowed in Step 1, then divide by 350.</p><p>c.  If the remainder is 51 or more, 1 additional travel day is authorized.</p><p>3</p><p>Allow 1 day for travel by air, train, or bus transportation.</p><p>4</p><p>Add Step 2 and Step 3 together, to determine the authorized travel time.</p><p> </p><p>C.  Transoceanic Travel Time.  The actual time required for transoceanic travel by aircraft or ship over a usually traveled direct route is authorized.  The embarkation or debarkation day at the terminal or port while awaiting transportation is included, regardless of the arrival or departure hour.  </p><p></p><p>1.  When transoceanic travel is by POV for the entire distance between duty locations and is authorized by the AO as more advantageous to the Government, then travel time is based on travel by POV.</p><p></p><p>2.  When travel is by privately owned boat, travel time is based on the air travel time.</p><p></p><p>D.  Additional Travel Time.  The commanding officer may authorize or approve additional travel time for reasons beyond a civilian employee’s control.  The additional time may be authorized for the actual time used or for a shorter period.  The commanding officer may require additional documentation supporting the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>0539  CIVILIAN PCS PER DIEM</p><p></p><p>Per diem is payable for any days travel time is authorized.  However, it is not payable when the official travel period is 12 or fewer hours or for a full day of leave.  The specified per diem applies for all related travel unless otherwise stated in the JTR.  Per diem is payable for situations such as delays for reasons beyond the civilian employee’s control as determined by the Component, necessary delays awaiting further transportation, delays at the point of embarkation or point of debarkation, or a TDY en route.  Calculate en route per diem payment using the lesser of either the authorized travel time or the actual travel time.  See International Date Line computation example 1 and International Date Line computation example 2.</p><p>053901.  PCS Per Diem Allowance</p><p></p><p>A per diem rate includes a maximum reimbursement amount for lodging expenses and a fixed amount for M&amp;IE.  Reimbursement is limited to the lesser of the actual lodging cost or the applicable maximum amount.  Lodging receipts are required (see Chapter 2 for miscellaneous reimbursable expenses).  The M&amp;IE rate, or portion thereof, is payable to a civilian employee without itemization of expenses or receipts. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-74.

Lodging Plus Per Diem (Lodging Plus) Computation Method.  Compute per diem for all PCS travel using the Lodging Plus method.  Per diem is the actual amount the civilian employee pays for lodging plus an allowance for M&amp;IE for each travel day.  Per diem is limited to the Standard CONUS per diem rate for locations in the CONUS or the maximum locality per diem rate for locations OCONUS.  Per diem is calculated at 75% of the appropriate locality rate for M&amp;IE for the day of departure or day of arrival at any of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  A PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A designated place or alternate destination point.</p><p></p><p>3.  A safe haven when PCS travel is from a safe haven location.</p><p></p><p>4.  RAT leave locations when Lodging Plus per diem is paid. </p><p></p><p>5.  Travel that begins and ends on the same day when travel is more than 12 hours. </p><p></p><p>B.  PCS Per Diem when Traveling by Airplane, Train, Ship, or Bus.  The per diem rate is calculated using the new PDS rate for PCS travel when transportation is personally procured, or furnished as transportation in-kind, for separate legs of travel.  If there is an overnight stop or TDY en route, the per diem rate for the arrival day at the overnight stop or TDY site is calculated using that location’s rate.  The new PDS rate does not override the destination rate logic of the Lodging Plus per diem computation method.  M&amp;IE for the new PDS arrival day is the new PDS rate whether or not there is a stopover.  Per diem is not authorized for a civilian employee or dependent when traveling aboard a commercial ship when meals are furnished without charge, or are part of the accommodations cost, except on embarkation and debarkation days.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-75.  PCS Per Diem Computations for Lodging Plus Per Diem</p><p>For…</p><p>Then per diem is…</p><p>1</p><p>the day travel begins (the departure day from the PDS, home, or other authorized point) and lodging is required,</p><p>the actual lodging cost incurred by the civilian employee, limited to the applicable lodging rate, plus 75% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate.</p><p>2</p><p>the day travel begins (the departure day from the PDS, home, or other authorized point) and lodging is not required,</p><p>75% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate (Standard CONUS or the locality rate for the new PDS OCONUS) for 1 day.</p><p>3</p><p>other full calendar days when lodging is required and the civilian employee is still en route,</p><p>the maximum rate for a stopover point at which lodging is obtained, plus the applicable M&amp;IE rate (Standard CONUS or destination OCONUS).</p><p>4</p><p>other full calendar days when lodging is not required while the civilian employee is still en route,</p><p>The M&amp;IE rate for the next official destination.</p><p>5</p><p>the day travel ends and lodging is required,</p><p>the lesser of the actual lodging cost incurred by the civilian employee or the applicable lodging rate plus 75% of the applicable M&amp;IE rate (Standard CONUS or the locality rate for the new PDS OCONUS).</p><p>6</p><p>the day travel ends and lodging is not required,</p><p>75% of the M&amp;IE rate (Standard CONUS or the locality rate for the new PDS OCONUS) for that day.</p><p></p><p>C.  HHT, en Route Travel to the New PDS, RAT, and Separation Travel.  The per diem rates for PDT apply when computing per diem for HHT (Standard CONUS rate for the Lodging Plus method and locality rate for the lump sum method), en route travel to the new PDS, RAT, and separation.  When computing en route travel per diem to a new PDS, the standard CONUS M&amp;IE rate or M&amp;IE locality rate OCONUS applies to the arrival day at the new PDS.  Use Table 5-75 when computing per diem for either of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  All en route travel to the actual residence for separation.  The Standard CONUS M&amp;IE rate is applicable on the arrival day at the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  En route travel to the new PDS that begins and ends on the same day and is more than 12 hours but less than 24 hours, whether or not for separation.</p><p></p><p>D.  Per Diem for POV Travel Involving a Car Ferry</p><p></p><p>1.  If lodging on the car ferry is not required, then the M&amp;IE while on the ferry is the rate applicable to traveler’s location at 2400 on the day departing the ferry.</p><p></p><p>2.  If lodging is required, then:</p><p></p><p>a.  Reimbursement for required accommodations is authorized unless included in the ferry transportation cost.</p><p></p><p>b.  The daily per diem rate for the arrival day on the ferry through the day before the departure day from the ferry is equal to the highest CONUS M&amp;IE rate.</p><p></p><p>c.  On the departure day from the ferry, the M&amp;IE rate is the rate applicable to the traveler’s location at 2400 on that day. </p><p></p><p>053902.  PCS Per Diem for Dependents</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee is authorized per diem for each dependent’s actual travel between the old PDS and new PDS when the civilian employee is transferred, or for other travel in this Part, limited to the direct route between authorized points.  Travel time for a dependent is determined under par. 053807 in the same manner as for the civilian employee, not by the civilian employee’s travel time or the amount of per diem paid for the civilian employee’s PCS travel.  No per diem is payable for travel of 12 or fewer hours.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-76.  PCS Per Diem Rules for a Civilian Employee’s Dependent</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>the travel origin or destination is other than the old PDS or the new PDS,</p><p>per diem is limited to the amount authorized between the old PDS and new PDS. </p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee or dependent obtains lodging from friends or relatives,</p><p>the civilian employee may be reimbursed for the additional lodging costs that the host incurs for the accommodation if the civilian employee can substantiate the costs and the AO determines the costs are reasonable.</p><p>3</p><p>meals are furnished without charge, or are part of the accommodations cost, aboard a commercial ship,</p><p>per diem is not authorized except on embarkation and debarkation days.</p><p>4</p><p>a dependent’s transportation cost is limited to Government-procured air transportation,</p><p>per diem is limited to the amount authorized if the dependent had used Government-procured air transportation.</p><p>5</p><p>a civilian employee is a new appointee assigned to a first PDS,</p><p>per diem is not authorized for a dependent. </p><p>6</p><p>a civilian employee is assigned to a PDS OCONUS and is returning to the actual residence for separation,</p><p></p><p>7</p><p>a civilian employee is assigned OCONUS in conjunction with RAT,</p><p></p><p>8</p><p>transportation is authorized instead of per diem or AEA for a civilian employee while at a training location,</p><p></p><p>9</p><p>a dependent travels to, from, or while at an en route TDY location</p><p></p><p>10</p><p>return travel for cases involving RAT is to a new PDS OCONUS in a different geographic locality from the old PDS,</p><p>dependent per diem (related to the PCS, not the RAT) must be computed on the basis of constructed travel time between the old PDS and new PDS. </p><p>11</p><p>a student dependent, in a foreign area, travels to and from school as specified in par. 053806,</p><p>per diem is authorized for required travel time by the authorized transportation mode at the same rates and percentages as for a civilian employee on a TDY, and no per diem is paid if travel is 12 or fewer hours</p><p> *A civilian employee’s TDY location is not a delay point for a dependent.

An HHT is a discretionary allowance authorized on a case-by-case basis, when a civilian employee has accepted a permanent transfer, and the circumstances indicate the need.  The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if an HHT is necessary.  The HHT trip duration, including travel time, is limited to 10 days.  If the HHT is authorized, it should lower the Government’s relocation costs by reducing the time in temporary lodging.  A civilian employee is in a travel status while performing HHT during the authorized absence period. </p><p>054001.  Eligibility and Authorization for HHT </p><p></p><p>Table 5-78.  Travelers Eligible for an HHT</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.  A civilian employee.  </p><p>b.  Civilian employee’s spouse.</p><p>c.  Attendant or escort for civilian employee or spouse.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Authorized</p><p>a.  A domestic partner.</p><p>b.  Civilian employee’s or spouse’s children.</p><p>c.  New appointee.</p><p>d.  New appointee’s spouse.</p><p>e.  Student trainee on first duty station travel.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  For a civilian employee to be authorized an HHT for PCS, both the old PDS and new PDS must be located within the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS, and be 75 or more miles apart by a usually traveled surface route according to the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD).  HHT may not be authorized for any of the following reasons:</p><p></p><p>1.  To assist a civilian employee in deciding whether or not to accept a transfer.</p><p></p><p>2.  Government housing, or other prearranged housing, will be assigned at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  If the civilian employee is at a training location in section 0326 and is authorized dependent or HHG transportation”</p><p></p><p>B.  AO Considerations.  The AO must determine whether the HHT will be reimbursed using the Lodging Plus method or a lump sum, the appropriate HHT duration, and the authorized transportation modes to and from the new PDS location, and for local travel while house hunting.  An AO must minimize HHT allowances or not authorize them when other satisfactory and more economical alternatives are available.  The DoD Component may avoid or shorten the HHT duration by providing assistance and information to a civilian employee concerning housing conditions and markets at the new PDS location.  The AO must consider the following factors before authorizing HHT: </p><p></p><p>1.  Arranging a Permanent Residence before a Move.  If the civilian employee has a large family and must promptly vacate the residence at the old PDS, it might be less costly to the Government, as well as more convenient to the civilian employee, to complete arrangements for a new residence before the move actually takes place.</p><p></p><p>2.  Arranging a Permanent Residence while in Temporary Lodging.  If the civilian employee has no family or a small family, it might be less costly to allow the civilian employee and family to remain in temporary lodging at the new PDS for a somewhat longer period than might otherwise be authorized, subject to TQSE limitations, until the civilian employee finds a permanent residence.</p><p></p><p>3.  Avoiding an Advance Trip.  If TQSE is authorized, an HHT may possibly be avoided.  It might be more advantageous to the Government and the civilian employee for the civilian employee’s dependents to remain at the former residence while the civilian employee occupies temporary lodging at the new PDS.  During that time, he or she can select a permanent residence after becoming familiar with the new PDS area.</p><p></p><p>4.  TDY at the New PDS.  When a civilian employee is on a TDY and it is known that the TDY location will become the new PDS (before the permanent transfer is effective) an HHT should not be necessary.</p><p></p><p>054002.  Separate Trips by Civilian Employee and Spouse</p><p></p><p>Separate HHTs by the civilian employee and spouse are allowed; however, the Government’s overall cost is limited to the cost of one round trip for the civilian employee and spouse traveling together.  Compare the cost of the civilian employee and his or spouse traveling separately on an HHT to the cost of a single round-trip HHT that they could make together and reimburse the lesser.  The Government’s overall cost for comparison and computation purposes includes per diem, transportation costs, and other miscellaneous reimbursable expenses.  Separate HHTs do not increase the 10-day limitation, regardless of the circumstances.  AEA is not authorized for HHT.  When a civilian employee’s spouse travels independently on an HHT, the per diem rate for the spouse is computed the same as the civilian employee’s using par. 020309.</p><p>054003.  Timing and Duration</p><p></p><p>An HHT may begin after the civilian employee signs a service agreement, the DoD Component establishes the reporting date to the new PDS, the DoD Component informs the civilian employee of the reporting date, and the travel order is issued.  A civilian employee must complete a round-trip HHT 1 day before reporting to the new PDS.  A spouse must complete a round-trip HHT 1 day before the family begins relocation to the new PDS, or by the time allowed for completing travel and transportation allowances runs out (see par. 053712).  A funded HHT, including travel time, is limited to 10 calendar days.</p><p></p><p>054004.  Transportation for an HHT </p><p></p><p>To receive reimbursement for HHT transportation expenses, a civilian employee must itemize the transportation expenses and have supporting receipts to submit with his or her travel claim.</p><p></p><p>A.  Transportation to and from a New PDS Locality.  When authorizing and approving a transportation mode, the objective is to minimize en route time and maximize new PDS time.  POV transportation is to the Government’s advantage when the distance to the new PDS is less than 250 miles.  However, a traveler cannot be required to use a POV, so the AO may authorize an alternate transportation mode.  When the distance to the new PDS is 250 or more miles, POV use is not to the Government’s advantage.  The AO may authorize or approve POV travel as to the Government’s advantage when, and only when, a written cost comparison demonstrates a POV is cost-effective.  If POV transportation is to the Government’s advantage, the MALT rate applies.  If the civilian employee travels by other than the authorized transportation mode, reimbursement is for the lesser of the actual transportation expenses or the authorized transportation cost.  The civilian employee is authorized transportation expenses, including transportation between carrier terminals.</p><p></p><p>B.  Local Transportation.  Reasonable expenses for local transportation at the new PDS are allowed.  Local transportation by train, bus, other public transit systems, commercially rented automobile, or a POV at the MALT rate may be authorized.  The local transportation mode must be consistent with the transportation mode authorized for travel to and from the PDS, for example, a rental car should not be authorized if POV transportation to the new PDS is authorized.  Taxi reimbursement is limited to transportation between carrier terminals and lodging.</p><p></p><p>054005.  Lodging and Per Diem </p><p></p><p>When a lump-sum reimbursement is offered to the civilian employee, the civilian employee may choose between the Lodging Plus method or the Lump Sum method for the HHT subsistence.</p><p></p><p>A.  Lodging Plus.  HHT subsistence expenses are ordinarily reimbursed under the Lodging Plus method.  Use the Standard CONUS per diem rate to compute the per diem in section 0203 and par. 053901 for one round trip of the civilian employee or spouse.  When the civilian employee and spouse travel together on an HHT, the per diem rate for the spouse is 75% of the civilian employee’s per diem rate.  A civilian employee paid per diem using the Lodging Plus method must itemize lodging expenses and retain lodging receipts.</p><p></p><p>B.  Lump Sum.  A DoD Component may offer to pay a lump sum for subsistence expenses.  Once the civilian employee signs a service agreement and accepts the HHT (lump sum) offer, then HHT (lump sum) is irrevocable.  A civilian employee paid for an HHT using the lump sum method does not require itemization, receipts for payment, or a cost comparison.  If the civilian employee and spouse both travel (together or separately) the lump sum amount is calculated by multiplying 6.25 by the applicable locality per diem rate.  If only one person (either the civilian employee or the spouse) travels, multiply 5 by the applicable locality per diem rate.  The lump sum determined with that calculation applies for the entire trip, regardless of the number of days authorized for the HHT.  Any balance from the HHT lump sum payment that the civilian employee does not use for expenses belongs to the civilian employee and is not subject to repayment to the Government.  The following are factors in determining whether to offer lump sum reimbursement:</p><p></p><p>Table 5-79.  Lodging and Per Diem Allowance for an HHT</p><p>Computation Method</p><p>One Civilian Employee or Spouse</p><p>Civilian Employee and Spouse</p><p>1</p><p>Lodging Plus</p><p>Use the Standard CONUS per diem rate in section 0203 and par. 053901.</p><p>The per diem rate for the spouse is 75% of the civilian employee’s per diem rate when they travel together.</p><p>2</p><p>Lump Sum</p><p>Multiply 5 by the applicable locality per diem rate.</p><p>Multiply 6.25 by the applicable locality per diem rate whether both travel together or separately.</p><p></p><p>1.  Ease of Administration.  Per diem payment under the Lodging Plus method requires submission of a travel claim to review and validate lodging expenses for accuracy and reasonableness.  A lump-sum reimbursement is easier to administer because an expense review is not required.</p><p></p><p>2.  Cost.  The AO must evaluate the cost of the Lump Sum and Lodging Plus options on a case-by-case basis.  A single, universal decision for all PCS moves is not authorized.  AEA may not be authorized or approved for an HHT.</p><p></p><p>054006.  No Return to Old PDS </p><p></p><p>If an HHT is authorized under the Lodging Plus method, and the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS instead of returning to the old PDS, HHT subsistence for the days spent seeking permanent housing up to the day before reporting for duty at the new PDS is not payable.  TQSE, if authorized, is payable instead of the HHT subsistence and the period cannot be greater than the number of days authorized for the HHT.  The one-way transportation is PCS travel.  Under these circumstances, a civilian employee is not in a duty status while house hunting.</p><p></p><p>054007.  HHT Advance </p><p></p><p>An advance for HHT expenses may be paid if an HHT is offered and chosen under the Lodging Plus method.  The advance is limited to the sum of the anticipated transportation costs and the maximum per diem allowable under the Lodging Plus method for the HHT location and duration.  If a lump sum HHT is offered and chosen, the anticipated transportation costs may be advanced.  The subsistence paid under HHT (lump sum) is a payment, not an advance.</p><p>054008.  HHT and TQSE </p><p></p><p>If a civilian employee is paid or reimbursed for HHT days, and authorized TQSE (AE) is later claimed for more than 30 days, the actual number of HHT days paid or reimbursed on either a Lodging Plus or a lump-sum basis are deducted from the first authorized 30-day TQSE (AE) period.  The number of days paid or reimbursed for an HHT are not deducted from TQSE (LS).</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>0541  MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE ALLOWANCE (MEA)</p><p></p><p>Miscellaneous expenses are the various costs associated with PCS that are not covered by other PCS allowances in the JTR.  An advance of MEA funds is not authorized.  To receive MEA reimbursement, a civilian employee must submit a travel claim, certify that the old PDS residence has been discontinued, and certify that a new PDS residence has been established.  If filing a supplemental claim for the difference between the “without dependent” MEA rate and “with dependent” MEA rate, the civilian employee must certify that the dependent has established a residence at the new PDS or other authorized location. </p><p></p><p>054101.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  To be eligible for an MEA, a PCS or TCS must be authorized or approved and the civilian employee must sign an appropriate service agreement.  An MEA is payable when a civilian employee vacates a residence at the old PDS and establishes a new temporary or permanent residence at the new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employees Ineligible for MEA.  The following personnel are ineligible to receive an MEA:</p><p></p><p>1.  A new appointee assigned to the first PDS to any position, including student trainee, Senior Executive Service (SES) and Presidential appointee.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee or new appointee on first duty station travel to a foreign area duty location OCONUS is not authorized an MEA under the JTR, but may be authorized the MEA portion of the foreign transfer allowance under the DSSR.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee performing RAT, unless a PCS is authorized or approved in conjunction with the RAT and the civilian employee has discontinued residence at one location and established a residence at a new location in connection with the PCS. </p><p></p><p>4.  A civilian employee assigned to a PDS OCONUS returning to the actual residence for separation.</p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee authorized transportation for dependents or HHG to or from a training location instead of per diem or AEA under par. 032602.</p><p></p><p>054102.  Civilian Employee with or without Dependent</p><p></p><p>A.  Flat Payment MEA.  The Flat Payment MEA amount, payable without receipts or itemized statements, depends on whether the civilian employee has a dependent.  Both the minimum and maximum payments are based on the civilian employee’s basic weekly gross pay, including locality pay, and are calculated based on the new PDS location. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-80.  Flat Payment MEA Rules</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a civilian employee has no dependent,</p><p>pay the lesser of $650 or the equivalent of 1 week’s basic gross pay.</p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent, and the dependent and HHG are not relocated,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent, and the dependent returns early (see par. 053805) without relocating the household when the civilian employee returns and is authorized PCS allowances,</p><p></p><p>4</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent,</p><p>pay the lesser of $1,300 or the equivalent of 2 weeks’ basic gross pay.</p><p>5</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent and the dependent moves from the residence at the old PDS to a different residence than the civilian employee’s residence at the new PDS,</p><p></p><p>6</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent and the dependent returns early (see par. 053805), and subsequently leaves a prior residence and establishes a new residence in connection with the civilian employee’s PCS,</p><p></p><p>7</p><p>a civilian employee has a dependent, and reports to the new PDS while the dependent remains at the old PDS, or other location, without leaving the old residence, and later relocates the dependent or HHG within 1 year and establishes a new residence,</p><p>the civilian employee is authorized the difference between the amount initially received and the amount allowed with a dependent, limited to the amount for a civilian employee without a dependent until they leave the old residence and establish a new residence.</p><p>8</p><p>there are two civilian employees in one household who discontinue the same residence at the old PDS and establish one residence at the new PDS*,</p><p>only one MEA is paid for two civilian employees at the “with dependent rate,” which is the lesser of $1,300 or the equivalent of 2 weeks’ basic gross pay. </p><p>9</p><p>there are two civilian employees in one household and both incurred separate relocation costs, such as the cost of identification document changes, that do not include common expenses, such as the cost of connecting or disconnecting utilities,</p><p>each are authorized an MEA at the “without dependent rate” (the lesser of $650 or the equivalent of 1 week’s basic gross pay).</p><p> *Even if each civilian employee, without dependents, has a travel order and is traveling as a “civilian employee,” as long as no separate relocation expenses are incurred by the civilian employees.  Since an MEA is payable to only one civilian employee, the other civilian employee, for MEA purposes only, is considered a dependent relocating with the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>B.  MEA above “Flat Rate”.  The AO may authorize or approve an MEA in excess of the flat-rate amount if the claim is justified by receipts of expenses incurred, and the total amount is limited to the civilian employee’s basic gross pay for 1 week, if the civilian employee has no dependent, or 2 weeks, if the civilian employee has a dependent who was relocated.  The allowable amount is limited to the maximum rate (Step 10) of Grade GS-13, in 5 U.S.C. §5332.  An MEA cannot be used for expenses in excess of the amounts reimbursed by any other allowances in the JTR or additional costs caused by the civilian employee shipping HHG that are more than the maximum weight allowance provided by law or the JTR.  An MEA is not authorized for costs that are not allowed in the JTR, or costs more than the maximum or are reimbursed under other provisions provided by law or in the JTR.  In no case may there be duplicate payments.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-81.  Examples of MEA Reimbursable and Non-Reimbursable Costs</p><p>1</p><p>Reimbursable</p><p>a.  Disconnecting or connecting appliances, equipment, and utilities involved in relocation, and converting appliances for operation on available utilities.</p><p>b.

Reassembly, set up, and tuning of a piano moved for a relocation.</p><p>e.  Pet care, child care, or adult care for dependent parents or other adult dependents incapable of self-care at home while the civilian employee or spouse are away on an HHT, or are packing or unpacking.</p><p>f.  Losses on non-transferable or non-refundable contracts for medical, dental, food lockers, education enrollment, or private institutional care, such as those provided only for dependents with disabilities.</p><p>g.  Vehicle registration, driver’s license, and taxes imposed for bringing vehicles into some jurisdictions, reinstalling a catalytic converter upon vehicle reentry into the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS for civilian employees participating in the DoD POV Import Control Program, securing a bond allowing a POV to be admitted into the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS for non-participants in the DoD POV Import Control Program.</p><p>h.  Required removal or installation by host country law of automobile parts.</p><p>i.  Rental agent fees customarily charged for securing housing in foreign countries.</p><p>j.  Miscellaneous expenses connected with cancellation of a contract to purchase a house due to a transfer in the Government’s interest.</p><p>k.  A post office box rental fee when rented to provide a constant mailing address between the time a civilian employee departs the old residence and occupies a residence at the new PDS.</p><p>l.  Cat and dog transportation and quarantine charges.  See par. 054103 for additional details concerning pet transportation and quarantine.</p><p>m.  Similar costs.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Reimbursable</p><p>a.  Purchasing appliances or equipment instead of conversion, the cost for replacing or repairing worn out or defective appliances or equipment, or electrical system upgrades to accommodate an appliance or equipment.</p><p>b.

Fines imposed for traffic infractions while en route to the new PDS or for other penalties imposed on the civilian employee or a dependent.</p><p>m.  Accident insurance premiums or liability costs incurred while traveling to the new PDS, or liability for uninsured damage caused by accidents for which the civilian employee or a dependent is responsible.</p><p>n.  Losses due to the sale or disposal of HHG items because they are not convenient or practicable to move.</p><p>o.  Losses or costs due to selling or buying homes and personal property.</p><p>p.  Higher income, real estate, sales, or other taxes due to establishing a residence in the new locality.</p><p></p><p>054103.  Pet Quarantine and Transportation</p><p></p><p>This paragraph clarifies pet quarantine reimbursement and transportation for PCS moves by a civilian employee.  A civilian employee transporting an exotic pet is required by law to have a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) certification before transporting the pet to or from foreign locations, and should contact the FWS before transporting the pet.</p><p></p><p>A.  Reimbursable Pet Expenses.  Cat and dog transportation and quarantine charges are not a separately reimbursable expense but may be claimed as MEA, only when claiming actual expenses for MEA.</p><p></p><p>B.  Non-reimbursable Pet Expenses.  Non-transportation and handling pet-related expenses are not reimbursable.  See the DTMO website for details on these expenses.  When a traveler does not use a City Pair Program airfare because a pet cannot travel on the same aircraft, the Government is not financially responsible for costs greater than the most economical travel routing.  Transportation of other animals, such as horses, fish, birds, and various rodents, are excluded due to their size, exotic nature, or restriction on shipping, host-country restrictions, and special handling difficulties. </p><p></p><p>0542  TEMPORARY QUARTERS SUBSISTENCE EXPENSE (TQSE)</p><p></p><p>TQSE is a discretionary, not mandatory, allowance unless a civilian employee returns from a foreign area through the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP).  The civilian employee may be authorized TQSE for a TCS.  TQSE may be authorized in addition to COLA payable under the DSSR (5 U.S.C. §5941) and any BAH, OHA, or BAS paid to a Uniformed Services member who is the spouse or domestic partner of a civilian employee authorized PCS expenses and allowances.  TQSE may also be paid in addition to TLA (see Chapter 9), or TLE (see section 0505) as long as payments cover different expenses.  Duplication of allowances is not authorized.  TQSE is not paid when the civilian employee is receiving other subsistence expense allowances (FTR §302-6.16).  Subsistence expenses are the expenses for lodging, food, and other necessities incurred while occupying temporary lodging for a PCS move. </p><p></p><p>054201.  TQSE Types</p><p></p><p>The two types of TQSE allowances are Actual Expense Reimbursement (TQSE (AE)) and Lump Sum Payment (TQSE (LS)).  The two types of TQSE are defined in Table 5-82.  The AO determines whether to change the TQSE payment method before any part of the travel order (including the HHT) has been executed, if requested, by the civilian employee.  Once the civilian employee chooses a TQSE method, the selection may not be changed if the travel order (including the HHT) has been executed, unless an exception is warranted based on clerical error.  An exception is allowed if all of the facts and circumstances support that a provision was intended and was omitted in error when preparing the order (GSBCA 16437-RELO, September 22, 2004).  After the AO determines that TQSE is necessary, TQSE (AE) cannot be denied because the civilian employee does not want TQSE (LS).</p><p></p><p>Table 5-82.  TQSE Type</p><p>Type of Expense</p><p>Definition</p><p>1</p><p>Actual Expense Reimbursement (TQSE (AE))</p><p>Reimbursement based on actual expenses.</p><p>2</p><p>Lump Sum Payment (TQSE (LS))</p><p>Flat amount based on the number of days authorized.</p><p></p><p>054202.  Eligibility </p><p></p><p>The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE is necessary.  An AO should deny TQSE when temporary lodging is not justified.  When temporary lodging is justified, an AO authorizes only a necessary TQSE period if the civilian employee or spouse makes an HHT or if a previous assignment at the new PDS enables the civilian employee to make arrangements for adequate, permanent private-sector housing.  TQSE must be authorized before temporary lodging is occupied and may not be approved after the fact for any days that have passed before TQSE is initially authorized, but the AO may approve extensions.  TQSE must start no later than 1 year after the civilian employee’s effective date of transfer, unless that time is extended as in par. 053712.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-83.  Eligibility Criteria for TQSE Authorization</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized </p><p>Only If…</p><p>a.  A PCS is authorized to a new PDS located in the CONUS or in a non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p>b.  The old PDS can be anywhere in the world.</p><p>c.  The old PDS and new PDS are 50 or more miles apart, according to map distances along a usually traveled surface route.</p><p>d.  Temporary lodging is occupied for a PCS transfer.</p><p>e.  The civilian employee signs an appropriate service agreement.</p><p>f.  The temporary lodging location is within reasonable proximity of the old PDS or new PDS unless the AO is convinced that the circumstances are unique to the individual civilian employee or dependent, are reasonably related to the transfer, have been adequately reviewed, and justify TQSE payment.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Authorized For…</p><p>a.  Vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the PCS.</p><p>b.  A civilian employee transferred to a foreign PDS.</p><p>c.  A civilian employee who occupies temporary lodging for an evacuation or other reason unrelated to a PCS.</p><p>d.  A new appointee assigned to a first PDS.</p><p>e.  A civilian employee assigned to a PDS OCONUS returning to the actual residence for separation.</p><p>f.  A civilian employee authorized or approved dependent or HHG transportation to or from a training location instead of per diem or AEA while at the training location in par. 032602.</p><p>g.  A civilian employee occupying permanent private-sector housing (with rental furniture) while HHG is en route.</p><p>h.  A civilian employee performing RAT, except when return is to a different non-foreign PDS OCONUS.</p><p>054203.  Temporary Lodging </p><p></p><p>Temporary lodging is private-sector lodging occupied temporarily at the old PDS or new PDS after a PCS is authorized.  A permanent residence is considered vacated and temporary for TQSE purposes when the HHG has been packed for moving and are unavailable to the residents. </p><p></p><p>A.  Permanent Housing Cannot Be Occupied.  Lodging occupied temporarily is temporary lodging when the civilian employee has arranged permanent housing and lodges in temporary quarters within the allowable time limit because the permanent housing cannot be occupied due to one of the following reasons.</p><p></p><p>1.  It remains occupied by the present tenant.</p><p></p><p>2.  It requires repairs or alternations that have not been completed.</p><p></p><p>3.  It is under construction and the expected completion date for the construction is within the TQSE time limit allowed in the travel order.  </p><p></p><p>Note:  TQSE authority for a civilian employee beyond that needed to seek an available private-sector residence is inappropriate if the civilian employee chooses to have a house built when there is an existing inventory of affordable housing.</p><p></p><p>B.  Temporary Lodging Becomes Permanent.  The AO may determine the lodging that the civilian employee initially occupied and later became a civilian employee’s permanent housing was “temporary lodging” for a specific time period.  The AO should consider lease duration, HHG movement into the lodging, lodging type, expressions of intent, attempts to secure permanent private-sector housing, and how long the civilian employee occupied the lodging.</p><p></p><p>054204.  Civilian Employee Returning from Foreign Area through the DoD Priority Placement Program (PPP) </p><p></p><p>The gaining activity pays the TQSE allowance when a civilian employee returning from an assignment in a foreign area is placed through the PPP.  For such moves, the TQSE is a non-discretionary allowance and the gaining activity must authorize and pay it when the civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements for a move due to a RIF or transfer of function.  TQSE for PPP is authorized according to the procedures in this paragraph, subject to the following limitations:</p><p></p><p>A.  TQSE (AE).  TQSE(AE) is authorized in accordance with paragraph 054206-A.</p><p></p><p>B.  TQSE (LS).  The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE (LS) is offered.  If the AO offers and the civilian employee accepts TQSE (LS), it must be authorized for 30 days.  TQSE (LS) is limited to 30 days, with no extensions under any circumstances.</p><p></p><p>054205.  Temporary Quarters Subsistence Allowance (TQSA) </p><p></p><p>TQSA assists in covering the cost of temporary lodging, plus reasonable meal and laundry expenses, incurred at a new foreign PDS OCONUS (see the DSSR).</p><p></p><p>A.  Applicable Payments OCONUS.  When TQSA is paid based in a foreign country, TQSE may not be paid for that location, but may be paid for the new location in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS.  TQSA cannot be paid in the CONUS or any non-foreign PDS OCONUS.  TQSA and TQSE cannot be paid for the same period.  TQSA paid on behalf of a dependent in a foreign country must not extend beyond the date preceding the civilian employee’s arrival date at the new PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS (see DSSR §124.2) unless a DoD Component determines that compelling reasons exist that would justify the extension of TQSA beyond the initial termination date.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transferring to the CONUS or Non-foreign Area OCONUS.  A civilian employee transferring from a foreign area PDS to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS may be authorized TQSE but not the Home Service Transfer Allowance (see DSSR §252.6).</p><p>054206.  TQSE (AE) Option</p><p></p><p>TQSE (AE) is based on the Standard CONUS per diem rate for temporary lodging occupied in any locality in the CONUS.  For a PDS OCONUS, TQSE (AE) is based on the PDS locality per diem rate.  The PDS locality per diem rate is used, not the per diem rate for the location of the temporary lodging OCONUS.  AEA may not be authorized or approved for TQSE (AE).  The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE (AE) is necessary and the time period authorized on a case-by-case basis.  TQSE (AE) reimbursement is for the lesser of the actual allowable expenses incurred for each day of the authorized period or the maximum allowable amount payable for that same eligibility period.  TQSE (AE) expenses are those directly related to temporary lodging occupancy within the TQSE eligibility period, and are reasonable and substantiated.  The AO may deny reimbursement of any claimed TQSE expenses that appear to be unreasonable if the traveler cannot justify the expenses with supporting documentation.  Under no circumstances may TQSE (AE) be paid for more than a total of 120 days.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-84.  TQSE (AE) Allowable and Non-Allowable Expenses</p><p>1</p><p>Allowed</p><p>a.  Fees and tips for meals and lodging.</p><p>b.  Meals and groceries.</p><p>c.  Laundry.</p><p>d.  Cleaning and pressing of clothing.</p><p>e.  Temporary lodging, including lodging taxes or, if temporary lodging is located in a foreign area, the cost of a value-added tax (VAT) relief certificate if the certificate is used to avoid paying the lodging tax.</p><p>f.  The cost of moving HHG to the temporary lodging and removing HHG from SIT for the sole purpose of furnishing the temporary lodging.  This HHG moving cost is a TQSE expense and not an HHG expense.</p><p>g.  The cost of moving the HHG from the temporary lodging to permanent private sector housing.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Allowed</p><p>a.  Local transportation expenses.</p><p>b.  Expenses above the maximum authorized.</p><p></p><p>A.  Time Limitations</p><p></p><p>1.  Initial TQSE (AE) Period.  TQSE (AE) may be authorized for 60 or fewer consecutive days, but only for the time that temporary lodging is required.</p><p></p><p>2.  Additional TQSE (AE) Period.  If a civilian employee provides acceptable written justification and documentation, an AO may authorize or approve TQSE (AE) for an additional 60 or fewer consecutive days to total no more than 120 days, including the initial TQSE (AE).  TQSE (AE)-period extensions are not automatic and must be held to a minimum.  The AO may authorize extensions only if he or she determines there are compelling reasons for the continued temporary lodging occupancy due to circumstances beyond the civilian employee’s control.  The civilian employee’s written justification describing the circumstances beyond his or her control and the AO’s documentation supporting the approval or denial of the requested extension must be retained.  Acceptable circumstances include, but not limited to, any of the following:</p><p>a.  Delayed HHG transportation or delivery to the new permanent private-sector housing due to extended transit time for ocean transportation, strikes, customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, floods, or other Acts of God.</p><p></p><p>b.  Delayed occupancy of new permanent private-sector housing due to unanticipated problems such as unforeseen delays in permanent-housing settlement or closing, or unforeseen short-term delays in new-dwelling construction.</p><p></p><p>c.  Inability to locate permanent private-sector housing adequate for family needs due to housing conditions at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Sudden illness, injury, or death of the civilian employee or of an immediate family member.</p><p></p><p>B.  Occupancy Time Frames.  The occupancy period for temporary lodging runs concurrently for the civilian employee and all dependents.  The civilian employee may occupy temporary lodging at one location while a dependent occupies temporary lodging at another location.  If a civilian employee moves HHG into temporary lodging occupied initially at a new PDS and continues occupancy indefinitely, the temporary lodging is considered “permanent private-sector housing” starting on the date the HHG is delivered.  However, the AO may determine it is still “temporary lodging” after considering lease duration, HHG movement into the lodging, lodging type, expressions of intent, attempts to secure permanent private-sector housing, and how long the civilian employee occupied the lodging. </p><p></p><p>1.  Starting Occupancy.  Temporary lodging occupancy may start as soon as the civilian employee has signed a service agreement and TQSE allowances have been authorized in a PCS order.  TQSE must begin within 1 year after the civilian employee’s effective date of transfer, unless that time is extended in par. 053712.</p><p></p><p>2.  Occupancy Interruptions</p><p></p><p>a.  Once TQSE (AE) begins, the period continuously runs uninterrupted until the civilian employee or any dependent occupies permanent lodging or the authorized time period ends.  Events that interrupt the TQSE (AE) continuous period are: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Actual travel time for travel between the old PDS and new PDS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Necessary official duties, such as an intervening TDY or military duty.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Non-official necessary interruptions, such as hospitalization. </p><p></p><p>(4)  Approved sick leave but not annual leave.</p><p></p><p>b.  Other reasons beyond the civilian employee’s control interrupt the continuous period if acceptable to the AO.</p><p></p><p>c.  When official travel interrupts occupancy of temporary lodging, the actual time en route, limited to the authorized allowable travel time, is excluded from the eligibility period, which resumes when temporary lodging is reoccupied.  The time period continues to run if a dependent occupies temporary lodging at the civilian employee’s new PDS, or another location, during the civilian employee’s TDY or military duty training assignment.  When a civilian employee retains temporary lodging while on a TDY, the cost is reimbursed as part of the TQSE (AE) allowance (in addition to per diem received for the TDY) if the AO determines that the civilian employee acted reasonably in retaining the temporary lodging.</p><p></p><p>d.  The absence period is excluded from the number of days authorized for occupying temporary lodging.  The civilian employee is eligible for TQSE (AE) when he or she resumes occupying temporary lodging at the new PDS.  TQSE eligibility continues for the remainder of the authorized time, if necessary.</p><p></p><p>3.  Ending Occupancy.  Temporary lodging occupancy ends when the civilian employee or a dependent occupies permanent private-sector housing or the authorized time period expires, whichever occurs first.</p><p></p><p>C.  Receipts and Supporting Statement.  Receipts and a written supporting statement must accompany a TQSE (AE) claim.  Use DD Form 2912, “Claim for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense (TQSE),” to document TQSE expenses for reimbursement.  Actual expenses must be itemized in a manner that permits a review of amounts spent daily for lodging, meals, and other allowable subsistence expenses. </p><p></p><p>1.  Receipts.  Receipts are required for lodging costs paid and must show the location, dates, and who occupied the lodging.  Any single expense of $75 or more requires a receipt, including a single meal expense.</p><p></p><p>2.  Supporting Statement.  The supporting statement must include:</p><p></p><p>a.  The actual cost of each meal, the day and date on which each meal was consumed, where it was purchased (restaurant or grocery store), and who consumed it.</p><p></p><p>b.  Travel status and temporary lodging occupancy (for subsistence expense purposes) that occur the same day, the date, and the arrival and departure times at the temporary lodging location.</p><p></p><p>c.  The date that permanent private-sector housing occupancy starts or the date that HHG is moved into permanent private-sector housing.</p><p></p><p>d.  The amount of lodging paid for each day.</p><p></p><p>D.  Conditions Affecting Reimbursement</p><p></p><p>1.  Partial Days of TQSE (AE).  Temporary lodging occupancy for less than a whole calendar day is the same as 1 full calendar day for TQSE (AE) reimbursement. </p><p></p><p>2.  En Route Travel.  Reimbursement may not be paid under both TQSE (AE) and another subsistence expense allowance within the same calendar day, unless TQSE (AE) is claimed on the same day that en route travel per diem ends.  In this case, compute en route travel per diem under applicable partial-day rules and claim TQSE (AE) reimbursement for expenses incurred after 1800 (6 p.m.) on that day.  Par. 054205 explains limitations on duplication of allowances. </p><p></p><p>3.  Temporary Lodging Occupancy in All Other Cases.  The TQSE (AE) period starts at 0001 of the calendar day that TQSE (AE) reimbursement is claimed, provided temporary lodging is occupied during that calendar day. </p><p></p><p>4.  TQSE (AE) Period Termination.  The temporary lodging period ends at 2400 on the last day of eligibility. </p><p></p><p>5.  Meal Preparation in Temporary Lodging.  If the temporary lodging has meal-preparation facilities available and those facilities are used, the cost for groceries consumed on a daily basis is allowable.  Claims must show the total amount for each daily meal.</p><p></p><p>6.  Lodging with a Friend or Relative.  When an official traveler lodges with a friend or relative the official traveler may be reimbursed for additional lodging costs the host incurs in accommodating the traveler if the traveler can substantiate the costs and the AO determines the costs are reasonable.  The traveler may not be reimbursed the cost of comparable conventional lodging in the area or a flat token amount.  A traveler who lodges with a friend or relative is authorized the appropriate M&amp;IE rate, if otherwise eligible. </p><p></p><p>7.  Allowable Expenses when an Apartment, House, Mobile Home or Recreational Vehicle Is Rented or Used for Lodging</p><p></p><p>a.  When a civilian employee on PCS at the old or new PDS rents a furnished or unfurnished apartment, house, mobile home, or recreational vehicle for use as lodging, TQSE (AE) lodging expenses are computed according to par. 020303.  An apartment, house, or mobile home that is already or will become the PDS permanent residence cannot also be used as a temporary residence.</p><p></p><p>b.  To calculate the reimbursement amount, determine the daily TQSE (AE) lodging rate and prorate the total allowable expenses used by the number of TQSE (AE) days used then compare the actual daily TQSE (AE) lodging amount against the Standard CONUS daily lodging rate and pay the lesser amount.</p><p></p><p>8.  Reimbursement Limitation when Purchasing a Mobile Home.  TQSE (AE) expenses are limited to the temporary expenses listed in par. 020303 when a mobile home is purchased as a temporary residence and used while seeking a primary residence at the new PDS other than the mobile home being used as temporary lodging.  Real estate expenses, such as mortgage or interest fees, are not authorized.  If the civilian employee’s primary residence is already or will become the home used as a temporary residence, TQSE is not authorized.</p><p></p><p>9.  HHT Deduction</p><p></p><p>a.  If a civilian employee is paid or reimbursed for HHT days and authorized TQSE (AE) is subsequently claimed for more than 30 days, the actual number of HHT days paid or reimbursed, whether on a Lodging Plus or lump sum basis, are deducted from the first 30-day TQSE (AE) period authorized, limited to 10 days.  When HHT (Lump Sum) is paid, 5 days are subtracted from TQSE (AE) if one person travels on the HHT.  Subtract 6 days from TQSE (AE) if more than one person travels on the HHT (Lump Sum).  If an HHT was originally authorized for more than the number of days used, subtract the actual number of HHT days used.  The number of days authorized for TQSE (AE) is reduced for the entire family when the civilian employee, the spouse, or both make an HHT.  There is no deduction from the number of days authorized for TQSE (LS) for the number of days paid under HHT (Lump Sum) or reimbursed under HHT (Lodging Plus Method) for an HHT, and TQSE (LS) is paid for the number of days authorized, not the number of days temporary lodging was occupied. </p><p></p><p>b.  To illustrate the deduction of an HHT from TQSE(AE), one example is provided below.  Additional examples are on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p>(1)  Scenario - TQSE(AE) with HHT Lodging Plus Deduction.  A civilian employee is authorized and used 60 days of TQSE(AE) in the CONUS.  The civilian employee used and was reimbursed 9 days for an HHT using the Lodging Plus method.  </p><p></p><p>(2)  Computation</p><p></p><p>(a)  TQSE(AE) was authorized and claimed for more than 30 days.  Deduct the 9 days used on the HHT from the first 30 day period of TQSE(AE).  The civilian employee is reimbursed expenses for the first 21 days at the amounts he or she actually spent for each day, limited to the applicable daily percentage of the Standard CONUS rate for the first 30-day period.  The civilian employee must itemize the expenses actually incurred on each day. </p><p></p><p>(b)  The civilian employee is reimbursed expenses for the next 30 days at the amounts he or she actually spent, limited to the applicable reduced percentage of the Standard CONUS rate for the second and subsequent 30-day periods.  </p><p></p><p>(3)  The first 21 days of the TQSE(AE) are paid at the higher percentage rate of the Standard CONUS rate.  The remaining 30 days are paid at the reduced percentage of the Standard CONUS rate.  Although 60 days of TQSE(AE) were authorized and used, the civilian employee is actually paid for 51 days.  The difference is the 9 days of HHT that were deducted from the initial 30-day period.</p><p></p><p>10.  Per Diem Rates.  While in the CONUS, use the Standard CONUS per diem rate.  If OCONUS, both non-foreign and foreign areas OCONUS, use the PDS locality per diem rate, not the lodging location, in effect on the days temporary lodging is occupied.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-85.  Per Diem Daily Rate for TQSE (AE)</p><p>First 30 days</p><p>If…</p><p>Then the daily rate is limited to…</p><p>1</p><p>a civilian employee is in TQSE (AE), </p><p>the maximum per diem rate.</p><p>2</p><p>an unaccompanied spouse or unaccompanied domestic partner occupies temporary lodging in a location separate from the civilian employee’s location,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>a spouse or domestic partner accompanies a civilian employee in TQSE (AE),</p><p>75% of the daily maximum per diem rate.</p><p>4</p><p>a dependent other than a spouse or domestic partner is age 12 or older,</p><p></p><p>5</p><p>a dependent is under age 12,</p><p>50% of the daily maximum per diem rate.</p><p>Second 30 days</p><p>6</p><p>a civilian employee, unaccompanied spouse, or unaccompanied domestic partner occupies temporary lodging in a location separate from the civilian employee’s location,</p><p>75% of the daily maximum per diem rate.</p><p>7</p><p>a spouse or domestic partner accompanies a civilian employee,</p><p>50% of the daily maximum per diem rate.</p><p>8</p><p>a dependent, other than a spouse or domestic partner, is age 12 or older,</p><p></p><p>9</p><p>a dependent is under age 12,</p><p>40% of the daily maximum per diem rate.</p><p></p><p>E.  TQSE After the First 60 Days.  When the AO authorizes a time extension in TQSE (AE) for temporary lodging occupancy beyond the first 60 days, the additional days must be computed at the same rates allowed for the second 30-day period in Table 5-85.</p><p></p><p>F.  Denying Reimbursement.  The AO may deny reimbursement of any claimed TQSE lodging or meal expenses that appear to be unreasonable if the traveler cannot justify the expenses when TQSE (AE) is being paid.  The lack of adequate documentation for the questionable TQSE period does not prohibit reimbursement for the remaining TQSE days nor does the Tainted Day rule apply.  The Tainted Day rule applies only when there is reasonable suspicion of fraud supported by evidence sufficient to overcome the usual presumption of honesty and fair dealing by the civilian employee.  The Tainted Day rule would void the TQSE (AE) claim in its entirety when any authorized TQSE day is tainted for fraudulent expenses.</p><p></p><p>054207.  TQSE (AE) Advance</p><p></p><p>A TQSE (AE) advance may be paid to cover the estimated expenses for up to 30 days.  The DoD Component may subsequently pay additional travel advances for periods up to 30 days, limited to the maximum TQSE (AE) period.</p><p></p><p>054208.  TQSE (LS) Option</p><p></p><p>TQSE (LS) is a fixed-payment amount that is always based on the locality per diem rate that is in effect at either the old PDS or new PDS on the date that the fixed offer was accepted.  The applicable per diem rate is the one in effect on the day the civilian employee accepts the fixed-rate offer for the season in which the civilian employee travels, or a combination, depending on where temporary quarters will be occupied.  For example, when a civilian employee accepts an offer in November for the following June, use the per diem rate in effect the following June.  The AO, not the civilian employee, determines if TQSE (LS) instead of TQSE (AE) is offered and the number of days necessary, limited to 30 days.</p><p></p><p>A.  AO Considerations.  The following factors must be considered before authorizing TQSE (LS):</p><p></p><p>1.  Ease of Administration.  TQSE (LS) does not require the review of claims, receipts, and supporting statements for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount because receipts and supporting statements are not required.  The civilian employee is paid before the occupancy of temporary lodging, eliminating the after-the-fact voucher process.</p><p></p><p>2.  Cost.  The AO should compare the cost of TQSE (LS) to the cost of TQSE (AE). </p><p></p><p>3.  Civilian Employee Choice.  If the AO offers a civilian employee the TQSE (LS) option, the civilian employee must choose between it and TQSE (AE) and the travel order must document that decision.  The TQSE (LS) option is only an offer and the civilian employee is not obligated to accept it.  A civilian employee may decline the TQSE (LS) offer and choose to be reimbursed by TQSE (AE).</p><p></p><p>Note:  If the AO inadvertently fails to offer a civilian employee TQSE (LS) and the civilian employee’s PCS travel order reflects TQSE as authorized, but does not clearly reflect the TQSE (AE) method, the Service or Agency may correct the civilian employee’s PCS order to permit the TQSE (LS) option if the civilian employee requests.</p><p></p><p>B.  Payment Limitations</p><p></p><p>1.  Temporary lodging must be occupied for TQSE (LS) to be paid.</p><p>2.  The civilian employee must sign a statement, which must be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that he or she will occupy temporary lodging and incur TQSE expenses.  If temporary lodging is not occupied and no expense was incurred, the civilian employee must return the TQSE (LS) payment.</p><p></p><p>3.  The number of days offered for TQSE (LS) is prospective and must be established in advance.  TQSE (LS) cannot be authorized for more than 30 days under any circumstances.</p><p></p><p>4.  Once TQSE (LS) is selected, the civilian employee may not be paid any additional TQSE if the TQSE (LS) is inadequate to cover temporary living expenses.  The fixed-payment amount does not change for any revised PDS per diem rates effective after the date the civilian employee accepts the offer.</p><p></p><p>5.  Although receipts and supporting documentation are not required for TQSE (LS) payment, the civilian employee should retain lodging receipts or other proof that temporary lodging was occupied for at least 1 night in case the AO requests proof.  Without sufficient proof, the Service or Agency may require TQSE (LS) repayment.  </p><p></p><p>6.  If the TQSE (LS) is greater than the amount necessary to cover the civilian employee’s TQSE expenses, any balance belongs to the civilian employee as long as temporary lodging was occupied, even if the lodging was occupied for fewer days than authorized.</p><p></p><p>C.  Time Limitation.  The Service or Agency cannot impose limitations on the TQSE (LS) start date.</p><p></p><p>D.  Erroneous Advice.  Erroneous advice provided by Government officials is not a basis for reimbursement.  A civilian employee may not be paid for additional days beyond those originally authorized, even if he or she erroneously inferred or was told that TQSE (LS) would continue beyond 30 days. </p><p></p><p>E.  Computation Rules</p><p></p><p>1.  HHT.  The number of days paid or reimbursed for an HHT are not deducted from TQSE (LS).</p><p></p><p>2.  Number of People.  TQSE (LS) payment is based on the civilian employee and number of dependents actually moving to the new PDS, not those who actually occupy the temporary lodging.  If payment was initially made for more dependents than actually move to the new PDS, then the civilian employee must pay back the TQSE (LS) paid for any dependent who did not move.</p><p></p><p>3.  Per Diem Rate.  The per diem rate used for TQSE (LS) payment is the maximum locality per diem rate at either the old or new PDS, whether in the CONUS or OCONUS (see par. 054207).</p><p></p><p>4.  Computation.  Table 5-86 specifies the steps for determining TQSE (LS).</p><p></p><p>Table 5-86.  Computations for Determining TQSE (LS) Amount</p><p>1</p><p>Civilian Employee</p><p>Multiply the locality per diem rate by 75% to compute the daily rate.  Then, multiply the daily rate by the number of days authorized. </p><p>2</p><p>Dependent</p><p>Multiply the maximum per diem rate by 25% to compute the daily rate.  Then, multiply the daily amount by the number of days authorized.</p><p>3</p><p>Total payment TQSE(LS) = Payment total for civilian employee + Payment total for dependents</p><p>0543  HHG TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE</p><p></p><p>HHG transportation is authorized from the old PDS or the actual residence, as applicable, to the new PDS, or other authorized location.  There are two types of HHG transportation methods:  the Government arranges for HHG transportation and where the civilian employee arranges the transportation.  If a Government move is authorized, but the civilian employee chooses to move him or herself, then the Government reimburses only the actual expenses, limited to what it would have cost the Government to ship the HHG.  If the civilian employee is authorized to arrange his or her own transportation, reimbursement is based on the GSA Commuted Rate Table, regardless of the actual cost of the move.  A civilian employee may receive an advance for HHG transportation and SIT when authorized under the commuted rate method (FTR §302-7).  An advance is not authorized for NTS of HHG (FTR §302-8). </p><p></p><p>054301.  Eligibility </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  The following types of civilian employees are eligible for HHG transportation and SIT at Government expense when relocation is in the Government’s interest:</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee transferred between official duty locations in the CONUS or OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A new appointee to the first official location in the CONUS or OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee returning to the CONUS for separation from an assignment OCONUS after completion of an agreed upon period of service.</p><p></p><p>4.  An SES civilian employee authorized last move home benefits (FTR §302-3).</p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee authorized a TCS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Origin and Destination.  HHG may be transported when: </p><p></p><p>1.  The shipment originates at the civilian employee’s last PDS, actual residence, or another location.</p><p></p><p>2.  A shipment originates at the last PDS and the remainder originates at one or more other locations.</p><p></p><p>3.  The destination is the new PDS or another location.</p><p></p><p>4.  The destinations for the HHG are the new PDS and one or more other locations.</p><p></p><p>054302.  Documentation (FTR §302-7) </p><p></p><p>See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy), for information on submitting travel vouchers, the forms to be used, and the number of copies required.  A civilian employee should attach one or more copies of the PCS order and other documents required by financial regulations to the voucher, including:</p><p></p><p>A.  Individual paid receipts for $75 or more for SIT, packing, hauling, or drayage bill, if applicable.</p><p></p><p>B.  The paid carrier’s original or certified copy of the bill of lading.  If a bill of lading is not available, the civilian employee must submit other evidence showing the origin, destination, and weight.</p><p></p><p>C.  An official weight certificate or authenticated weight designation.  The civilian employee may use constructed weight when proper weighing facilities are not available or if the partial load weight cannot be obtained at origin, en route, or at the destination.</p><p></p><p>054303.  Civilian Employee with a Civilian Employee or Service Member Spouse or Domestic Partner </p><p></p><p>A civilian employee whose spouse or domestic partner is another civilian employee or a Service member retains HHG transportation and storage allowances if a PCS order is issued to the civilian employee (even if the spouse or domestic partner may also have a PCS order).  They may not both be paid or reimbursed for shipping the same HHG, but may use the combined weight allowances to offset any excess weight incurred providing the HHG belongs to the civilian employee and his or her spouse or domestic partner.</p><p></p><p>054304.  HHG Weight Allowances (FTR §302-7)</p><p></p><p>The worldwide maximum weight of HHG that may be transported, including any HHG stored for that transportation, is 18,000 pounds net weight for each civilian employee.  For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000-pound allowance is added to the maximum weight allowance to cover packing materials.  Under no circumstances may the Government pay any expenses associated with excess weight.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-87.  Allowed Transportation of HHG and PBP&amp;E</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a civilian employee is transferred between official locations and authorized HHG shipment,</p><p>a total of 18,000 pounds net weight is authorized unless otherwise specified in the JTR.  See par. 054202 for origin and destination shipping points.</p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee is transferred between official locations,</p><p>add an allowance of up to 2,000 pounds to the maximum weight for the packing weight, covering barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar material.  This does not include pads, chains, dollies, and other equipment to load and secure the shipment. </p><p>3</p><p>a civilian employee is a new appointee,</p><p>transportation of HHG and PBP&amp;E from the actual residence to new official location, including to location of extended storage if authorized.</p><p>4</p><p>a civilian employee is returning from an assignment outside the continental United States for separation from Government service,</p><p>transportation of HHG and PBP&amp;E from the last official location and extended storage location, when authorized, to the actual residence is authorized.</p><p>5</p><p>a civilian employee is authorized separation travel at Government expense to his or her actual residence, but is retiring at the official location OCONUS or an alternate location,</p><p>transportation of HHG and PBP&amp;E from any location, including the actual residence and extended storage location, to any other location, including the official location OCONUS is authorized.  Costs are limited to the constructed transportation cost from the official location and extended storage location to the actual residence. </p><p>6</p><p>the civilian employee is an SES with last move home benefits,</p><p>transportation of HHG and PBP&amp;E from the last official location and extended storage location, when authorized, to the place of selection is authorized.</p><p>7</p><p>a civilian employee transfers to an administratively weight-restricted location OCONUS and Government furnishings are provided, </p><p>an allowance of up to:</p><p>a.  a total of 4,500 pounds of HHG net weight, including the weight of unaccompanied baggage, is authorized unless otherwise specified in the JTR.</p><p>b.  500 lbs. is added to the 4,500 lbs. net weight for packing weight, covering barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar material (not pads, chains, dollies and other equipment) to load and secure the shipment.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Administrative Weight Limitation.  Although the Government often provides furnishings at a location OCONUS, a civilian employee who transfers from a weight-restricted PDS OCONUS to a PDS that does not provide Government furnishings may be authorized HHG transportation from the old PDS, storage, or the designated place to the new PDS.  The total HHG transported must not exceed the authorized weight limit for the new PDS.  Only the authorized weight allowance shipped to the location OCONUS may be returned to the CONUS upon the duty-tour completion unless Service or Agency regulations provide an exception.  An order permitting the State Department administrative HHG weight limit of 7,200 pounds does not apply unless the civilian employee is assigned to the National Security Agency (NSA) and is authorized Department of State allowances by the National Security Act of 1959 (50 U.S.C. §3601-§3618) if implemented in NSA regulations.  Only 4,500 pounds net weight may be transported at Government expense subject to the provisions of the Administrative HHG Weight Allowance and the following exceptions:</p><p></p><p>1.  HHG Shipped Before Administrative Weight Restriction Effective Date.  The restricted weight allowance does not apply retroactively to HHG shipped to a location OCONUS before the effective date that an administrative weight limitation was imposed on that location.</p><p></p><p>2.  Government Furnishings Unavailable.  When Government furnishings are unavailable at the location OCONUS, an amount equal to the weight of personal furnishings required instead of the unavailable Government furnishings is added to the 4,500 pounds net weight.</p><p></p><p>3.  Government Furnishings Returned or Unserviceable.  If all Government furnishings are required to be returned to the Government or the Government furnishings become unserviceable and are not replaced, transportation of 18,000 pounds net weight of HHG, less the HHG weight previously shipped, is authorized from storage or a designated place to the current PDS.</p><p></p><p>4.  Weight Allowance Increase at Civilian Employee Request.  An AO or designee may increase the restricted HHG weight allowance if requested to do so by the civilian employee.  The increase must not be greater than 18,000 pounds net weight, with HHG previously shipped or continued in storage counting against the increased weight allowance.  One of the following conditions must apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee is assigned consecutive full-tour assignments to administratively weight-restricted areas.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee is on a tour of duty that is extended 1 year or longer within the same administratively weight-restricted area.</p><p></p><p>c.  Upon departure from an administratively weight-restricted area if the civilian employee acquired additional furnishings through marriage after he or she relocated to the administratively weight-restricted area. </p><p></p><p>d.  Undue hardship to the civilian employee would result if the full administrative weight restriction was imposed.</p><p></p><p>5.  Non-foreign Area OCONUS.  When a weight restriction is imposed for HHG shipped into a non-foreign area OCONUS, the weight restriction does not apply to shipments from that location as long as the new PDS is not a weight-restricted area.</p><p></p><p>6.  Weight Allowance Remainder.  Appropriate storage, or transportation to a designated place, is authorized for the remainder of a civilian employee’s weight allowance that cannot be transported to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Net Weight Determination</p><p></p><p>Table 5-88.  Calculating Net Weight</p><p>If the type of shipment is…</p><p>Then net weight…</p><p>1</p><p>a crated shipment, </p><p>a.  does not include the crating material weight.</p><p>b.  is 60% of the gross weight.</p><p>c.  may be computed at less than 60% of the gross weight if it was necessary for reasons beyond the civilian employee’s control to use unusually heavy crating and packing materials.</p><p>2</p><p>an uncrated shipment, whether commercial or non-commercial,</p><p>is allowed up to an additional 2,000 pounds for packing weight in addition to the lesser of the:*</p><p>a.  18,000 pounds .</p><p>b.  weight shown on the bill of lading or weight certificate. </p><p>3</p><p>a containerized shipment using containers designed for repeated use, such as lift vans, CONEX transporters, and HHG shipping boxes,</p><p>is computed like an uncrated shipment if the container’s weight includes interior bracing and padding materials.</p><p>4</p><p>a containerized shipment and the container’s weight does not include the weight of interior bracing and padding materials, </p><p>is 85% of the gross weight after subtracting the container’s weight.</p><p>5</p><p>a containerized shipment and the container’s gross weight cannot be determined,</p><p>is based on the constructed weight.</p><p>6</p><p>unable to be weighed because an adequate scale is unavailable at the origin, en route, or at the destination,</p><p>is computed using a constructed weight based on 7 pounds for a cubic foot of properly loaded space.  The civilian employee should obtain a statement from the carrier showing the amount of properly loaded space required for the shipment.</p><p>7</p><p>a partial load and the HHG weight cannot be determined without unloading the vehicle at the origin, en route, at the or destination,</p><p></p><p>8</p><p>one for which the carrier’s charges for a short-distance or metropolitan area move are computed on a basis other than the shipment’s weight or volume, such as payment based on an hourly rate and the distance involved, </p><p></p><p> *Exclude the weight of barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar packing materials.  This does not include pads, chains, dollies, and other equipment needed to load and secure the shipment.</p><p></p><p>C.  Excess Charges for HHG Transportation.  Erroneous advice, or lack of advice, by or from a Government civilian employee or representative does not create an entitlement to reimbursement for or shipment of HHG in excess of the weight allowed by statute.  When an excess weight status is known or suspected before transportation, such as based on observations made during a pre-move survey, the Transportation Officer must notify the civilian employee and the AO providing transportation funds.</p><p></p><p>1.  Government’s Responsibility.  The Government must pay the total transportation cost and other charges applicable to any excess weight greater than a civilian employee’s weight allowance and collect reimbursement from the civilian employee.  A Service or Agency may not pay the cost of transporting a civilian employee’s HHG above the maximum weight.  Review all transportation costs when determining excess costs, including storage (non-temporary or in transit) accessorial charges, and any other costs that the Government paid to move the HHG.</p><p></p><p>2.  Civilian Employee’s Responsibility.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for all excess weight charges associated with shipments heavier than the authorized weight allowance, even if the excess-weight status was known or suspected before transportation and the Transportation Officer did not notify the civilian employee or the AO providing transportation funds of the weight status.  Once HHG has arrived at its destination, the Service concerned determines the amount of the extra costs that the civilian employee must pay.  When HHG is weighed twice, the lesser weight is used to determine the civilian employee’s financial liability.  The civilian employee must pay for excess charges according to finance regulations. </p><p></p><p>3.  Excess Weight beyond Civilian Employee’s Control.  If it is determined that, for reasons beyond the civilian employee’s control, the use of heavy packing and crating materials caused the computed HHG net weight for crated HHG to be greater than the allowed weight, the facts must be fully documented and the case forwarded through the following channels with recommendations for an adjustment:</p><p></p><p>a.

Weight-Additive Items.  When a civilian employee’s HHG include an item, such as a jet ski, boat, three-wheel auto-trikes, or trailer, that can fit into a moving container for which a carrier assesses a weight additive surcharge using a weight greater than the actual weight of that item, that weight addition is not charged against the authorized weight allowance.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for special packing, crating, or handling expenses for such articles.</p><p>054305.  Transportation</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee or appointee who is authorized a move at Government expense is authorized HHG transportation.  HHG transportation is limited to items associated with the home and all personal effects belonging to a civilian employee and any dependents on the civilian employee’s PCS or TDY order’s effective date that legally may be accepted and transported by an authorized commercial transporter.  The total Government expenditure is limited to the cost of transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot by the method selected, from the civilian employee’s last PDS, or new appointee’s actual residence at the time of appointment, to the new PDS (FTR §302-7).  HHG improperly transported or otherwise unavoidably misdirected, through no fault of the civilian employee, must be transported to the proper destination at Government expense.  Table 5-89 specifies who is financially responsible for expenses associated with transporting HHG.  The Government-paid expenses listed in this table are for the transportation costs associated with the authorized weight limit. </p><p></p><p>Table 5-89.  Responsibility for Transportation Expenses</p><p>1</p><p>Government</p><p>Paid </p><p>Expenses</p><p>a.  Packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, drayage, and hauling, as necessary.</p><p>b.  Special technical servicing to prepare household appliances for safe transport and use at the destination, not connecting or disconnecting.</p><p>c.  Use of special rigging and equipment, such as cranes for HHG other than boats, for heavy or delicate articles, and handling.</p><p>d.  SIT for 90 or fewer days, as applicable.</p><p>e.  Delivery out of storage, regardless of how long the HHG has been in storage within the authorized 1-year period.*</p><p>f.  HHG must be delivered within the time limits of par. 054305-D.</p><p>2</p><p>Civilian Employee </p><p>Paid </p><p>Expenses</p><p>a.  Excess costs for transportation in more than one lot.**</p><p>b.  All transportation and HHG-related costs as a result of weight greater than the authorized weight allowance.</p><p>c.  Excess costs for transportation between other than authorized locations.</p><p>d.  Transportation of articles that are not HHG.</p><p>e.  Special services requested by the civilian employee, such as the cost of increased liability insurance.</p><p>f.  Transportation-related costs that are due to the civilian employee’s or an agent of the civilian employee’s negligence, such as an attempted pickup or attempted delivery charges (see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 401 (Personal Property)).</p><p>   *This includes shipments converted to storage that are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  Delivery out of SIT may be extended when an extension is granted under par. 054601-B.</p><p>  **This excludes an authorized unaccompanied baggage shipment to be transported separately from the HHG shipment and the authorized expedited transportation of items of extraordinary value.</p><p></p><p>Note:  Shipment of alcoholic beverages as HHG must conform to 27 U.S.C. §122.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Transportation under a PCS Order.  HHG transportation must be authorized on the PCS order.  HHG transportation may be authorized for a PCS before the PCS order is issued; however, the PCS order must subsequently contain HHG transportation authority or the costs become the civilian employee’s responsibility. </p><p></p><p>1.  HHG Shipment between PDSs in the CONUS.  HHG shipments in the CONUS are authorized between the civilian employee’s old PDS and new PDS.  However, the civilian employee may select another location for the origin or destination, or ship HHG partially from the old PDS or to the new PDS.  The Government’s cost obligation is limited to the “Best Value” costs between the old PDS and new PDS.  When the travel is to a first PDS, the Government’s cost is limited to the transportation cost from the actual residence at the time of appointment to the PDS by a usually traveled route.</p><p></p><p>2.  HHG Transportation to and between PDSs OCONUS.  HHG transportation OCONUS may be authorized between the same points as dependent movement in par. 053703.  When the authorized maximum HHG weight allowance is not shipped to the PDS OCONUS during the initial tour of duty, the civilian employee may be authorized transportation of the HHG balance through a renewal agreement for an additional tour of duty at the same or different PDS OCONUS.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for HHG transportation costs greater than the authorized weight limit.</p><p></p><p>3.  HHG Transportation from a PDS OCONUS to a PDS in the CONUS.  HHG transportation to the civilian employee’s actual residence, wherever located at the time of the assignment OCONUS, may be authorized when a civilian employee located OCONUS is authorized travel and transportation allowances at Government expense for a PCS, separation, or early return of dependent (ERD).  </p><p></p><p>a.  The advance return transportation of all or any part of a civilian employee’s HHG at Government expense, while the civilian employee remains assigned at a PDS OCONUS, is authorized only in connection with and under the same conditions as an early return of a dependent (ERD).  The Government may reimburse the authorized costs of advanced HHG transportation (even if there was no advance return of a dependent) when the civilian employee has earned return travel and transportation allowances and an official PCS order directs the civilian employee’s PCS or separation travel.  Reimbursement of the civilian employee’s transportation costs is limited to the Government’s cost to transport the HHG at the time of the civilian employee’s actual return travel.</p><p></p><p>b.  Advance HHG transportation at Government expense is not authorized unless the civilian employee has earned eligibility for return transportation by completing an agreed service period or advance return travel has been authorized for the civilian employee’s dependent as being in the Government’s interest.  If the civilian employee has not completed an agreed period of service, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the advance HHG transportation.  Government transportation facilities may not be used for unauthorized advance HHG transportation</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG of a civilian employee returning for separation may be transported at Government expense from the PDS OCONUS, NTS location, or both to the actual residence in the civilian employee’s service agreement.  HHG, including PBP&amp;E, transportation may be to any alternate destination, but reimbursement is limited to the Government’s constructed cost of transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence in the civilian employee’s service agreement.  This also applies when a civilian employee retires at the PDS OCONUS.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for any excess cost.  PBP&amp;E transported as an administrative expense to a location OCONUS may be returned as an administrative expense to a civilian employee’s actual residence for a civilian employee separating from Government service.  </p><p></p><p>d.  During an evacuation, HHG transportation may be authorized at Government expense to the same location designated for a dependent’s evacuation.  If it is necessary and practical, HHG may be transported later at Government expense to the evacuated civilian employee’s assigned PDS. </p><p></p><p>B.  Items of Extraordinary Value.  Items of extraordinary value may be transported by an expedited mode that provides satisfactory service at the “Best Value” to the Government, and may not be counted as unaccompanied baggage.  Examples include articles of gold and other precious metals, jewels, valuable art, rare and costly collections, and items of substantial value ordinarily worn or carried, such as cameras and accessories, binoculars, jewelry, including costume jewelry, that are prone to being stolen.  Items that are irreplaceable or have extreme financial or sentimental value do not receive special security though the civilian employee may purchase extra-value insurance.  The net weight of such shipments is charged against the civilian employee’s weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>C.  Reshipment of HHG.  HHG returned to the CONUS or the actual residence and then reshipped back to a PDS OCONUS during a continuous employment period OCONUS do not require a new service agreement.  The reasons for re-transportation of the same HHG must be beyond the civilian employee’s control and the Headquarters of the DoD Service or Agency concerned must authorize or approve the re-transportation. </p><p></p><p>D.  Time Limitation.  The time limit for HHG transportation, including when successive PCS assignments are involved (see par. 053706-B), is 1 year from the civilian employee’s reporting date at the new PDS unless extended due to an extension of the real estate allowance or lease-termination transaction.</p><p></p><p>1.  To and between PDSs OCONUS.  If HHG transportation OCONUS is delayed, subsequent HHG transportation must not be authorized unless at least 1 year remains on the civilian employee’s current service agreement or the civilian employee agrees to serve at least 1 year after the HHG arrives OCONUS.  Both Adak and Kodiak, Alaska, must serve at least 6 months rather than 1-year. </p><p></p><p>2.  From a PDS OCONUS.  HHG transportation from the area OCONUS must begin as soon as practicable after the effective date of the civilian employee’s PCS or return for separation.  If practicable, HHG transportation should be concurrent with the civilian employee’s departure or as soon afterward when appropriate transportation becomes available.  Under no circumstances can HHG transportation occur later than 1 year after the effective date of a new PDS reassignment, excluding any time that administrative embargoes or shipping restrictions make the transportation impossible.  When a civilian employee returns from an assignment OCONUS for separation, the following conditions apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  A civilian employee forfeits an HHG transportation allowance, including PBP&amp;E transportation, if he or she does not use it within 1 year after the effective date of the separation. </p><p></p><p>b.  Upon a written request from the civilian employee or a surviving dependent, the activity’s commanding officer OCONUS may authorize delayed HHG transportation from the area OCONUS, but a delayed shipment must be transported within 1 year after the effective date of the separation.</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG transportation from storage is authorized to the final destination if the shipment is transported within 1 year of the effective date of the civilian employee’s separation.</p><p></p><p>d.  SIT of HHG is limited to 90 or fewer days.  Upon a civilian employee’s written request, the AO may authorize an additional period limited to 90 or fewer days.  See par. 054307 for details on SIT.</p><p></p><p>E.  Transportation Methods</p><p></p><p>1.  Unaccompanied Baggage.  Unaccompanied baggage is part of the total HHG weight allowance.  The unaccompanied baggage weight allowance is 350 pounds net weight for each adult and dependent age 12 or older and 175 pounds net weight for each child under age 12.  When air transportation of unaccompanied baggage is used, par. 020207 applies.  Unaccompanied baggage weight allowances for air transportation include the actual weight of the luggage or packing material.  </p><p>a.  Government transportation policy and procedures apply to transporting unaccompanied baggage, except when transporting unaccompanied baggage by an expedited mode of air transportation in par. 054305-E1b.  The civilian employee or the civilian employee’s agent should contact the Transportation Officer as soon as possible before travel begins to arrange unaccompanied baggage transportation. </p><p></p><p>b.  The total unaccompanied baggage transported by air, or any expedited mode, is limited to 1,000 pounds net weight to, from, or between PDSs OCONUS.  Air transportation is not authorized when a civilian employee performs RAT, except when the additional tour of duty is served at a PDS in another area OCONUS and as authorized in par. 055006 and par. 055007.  Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air from the old PDS to the appropriate port of embarkation to arrive before the civilian employee or dependent’s transportation departure time.  Unaccompanied baggage may be transported by air when the transportation mode with the lowest “Best Value” cost cannot provide the required service, the civilian employee certifies the unaccompanied baggage is necessary to carry out the assigned duties, or the AO determines that expedited transportation is necessary to prevent undue hardship to the civilian employee or dependent.</p><p></p><p>2.  HHG.  The official designated by the Service or Agency must authorize or approve the HHG transportation method.  The designated official must complete a cost comparison before authorizing a transportation method on a PCS order.  The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing the cost difference between the actual expense and commuted rate methods of HHG transportation to the AO.</p><p></p><p>3.  Actual Expense</p><p></p><p>a.  If the Government procures the HHG’s transportation, it contracts, negotiates, audits, and pays the Transportation Service Provider (TSP), carrier, or vendor directly for transportation.  The PCS order must state the HHG transportation authority, that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG, and that unauthorized charges are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  Determine the Government-arranged transportation cost using the “Best Value” method in DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value) for the actual HHG weight transported, limited to the maximum weight allowance.</p><p></p><p>b.  If the PCS order states that the Government will arrange transportation of the HHG but the civilian employee personally procures the HHG transportation, then he or she must make the necessary arrangements for the HHG move and pay for the move.  Reimbursement is limited to actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee, limited to the “Best Value” cost of a Government-arranged move for the same HHG weight.</p><p></p><p>c.  If actual expense HHG transportation is authorized, and the civilian employee  transports HHG by Government-procured and  personally-procured transportation, the combined HHG shipments cannot exceed the authorized HHG weight allowance and the cost must be lower than that of Government-procured HHG transportation of the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places.  The same requirements for splitting a shipment apply when a civilian employee moves part of HHG him or herself.</p><p></p><p>4.  Commuted Rate (see GSA Commuted Rate Table).  The civilian employee’s PCS order must authorize or approve the Commuted Rate HHG transportation method.  The commuted-rate system may be used only for interstate HHG shipments between PDSs in the CONUS and is not authorized for intrastate moves.  The civilian employee arranges HHG transportation other than by shipping the HHG within a mobile home.  The civilian employee is authorized reimbursement under the GSA Commuted Rate ) for carrier services provided, including transportation, packing, unpacking, crating, drayage, and SIT.  Payment under the GSA Commuted Rate is regardless of the actual expenses incurred by the civilian employee.  The GSA Commuted Rate used must be in effect on the date the commercial shipper picks up the HHG, or if other than a commercial shipper is used, the date HHG begins movement.  The civilian employee must furnish the actual or constructed HHG transportation weight (cubic foot measurement).  A civilian employee may receive an advance for HHG transportation and SIT if authorized under the Commuted Rate.  The civilian employee may not receive any reimbursement if a third party, such as a new employer, pays for the HHG transportation.  </p><p></p><p>5.  Civilian Employee Responsibility.  A civilian employee who chooses to personally arrange for HHG transportation, whether by moving the HHG personally or by contracting directly for the HHG move, is entirely responsible for all issues related to the Status of Forces Agreement, use of U.S. carriers, import and export processes, and any tariffs, customs, or other related issues.  If Service regulations require, the civilian employee must also give preference to Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers when available. </p><p></p><p>6.  Limitations.  The Government will only pay for HHG transportation that is within the civilian employee’s authorized HHG weight allowance.  The cost is limited to what the Government would have incurred for transporting the maximum HHG weight allowance in one lot between authorized places, when a Government-arranged move is available.  All HHG transportation must be made on U.S. flag carriers, when reasonably available.  Payment on a commuted-rate basis is not authorized when the civilian employee fails to furnish the actual or constructed (cubic foot measurement) HHG transportation weight.  When the civilian employee does not provide the actual or constructed weight, reimbursement is limited to the amount actually paid by the civilian employee, or the commuted-rate amount, whichever is less.  The civilian employee must furnish an acceptable estimated weight statement.  HHG may not be moved at Government expense when any of the following occur: </p><p></p><p>a.  There is no official civilian employee movement, except when the advance return of a dependent from a PDS OCONUS is authorized.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee violates the agreement under which the HHG originally were transported.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee is not authorized transportation at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>d.  Authorized transportation is not completed within the specified time limits. </p><p></p><p>7.  Cost Comparison.  The AO must make a cost comparison between the actual expense and commuted rate methods of HHG transportation for each PCS order for each CONUS to CONUS PCS order.  The servicing Personal Property Shipping Office must provide the rate comparison by computing the cost difference between the Actual Expense and Commuted Rate methods of HHG transportation.  If the estimated costs are different by more than $100, the AO must authorize the more economical method on the PCS order.  A civilian employee’s request for a particular method is the determining factor if the costs are within $100 of each other.  A proper cost comparison must consider line-haul transportation charges, administrative costs, and expected accessorial and packing charges.  If the cost comparison is not made, or if the PCS order does not explicitly say that the actual expense method is authorized, the commuted rate method applies.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-90.  Considerations in Cost Comparison for Actual Expense and Commuted Rate Methods</p><p>Method</p><p>Advantages</p><p>Disadvantages</p><p>1</p><p>Commuted Rate</p><p>a.  The Government is not responsible for administrative expenses or for arranging HHG transportation.</p><p>b.  The civilian employee pays the authorized packing and accessorial charges from the amount allowed for those charges.</p><p>a.  The Government cannot take advantage of special discounts offered.</p><p>b.  An accurate cost estimate depends on weight estimate accuracy.</p><p>c.  Commuted Rate method does not apply to intrastate moves.</p><p>d.  Commuted Rate method may not fully reimburse a civilian employee’s out-of-pocket expenses.</p><p>2</p><p>Actual Expense</p><p>The Government may take advantage of special discounts offered.</p><p>a.  The Government is responsible for the administrative expense and for arranging HHG transportation.</p><p>b.  The Government’s cost depends on the weight involved, accessorial services required, packing quality, and the number of individual cartons, boxes, barrels, and wardrobes used by the carrier.</p><p></p><p>8.  Multiple Transfers.  When Services or Agencies have a large volume of HHG to move between the same origin and destination at the same time, but not a mass move, multiple transfers using the Actual Expense method should be considered (see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV (Personal Property)).</p><p></p><p>054306.  Non-Temporary Storage (NTS) (FTR §302-8)</p><p></p><p>NTS of HHG may be authorized in lieu of HHG transportation when the civilian employee is assigned to an isolated PDS in the CONUS, a PDS OCONUS that limits HHG transportation, a PDS OCONUS and NTS is in the Government’s best interest or more cost-effective, or a TCS (see par. 053714-C1).  An advance is not authorized for NTS of HHG.  NTS of HHG is not permitted for a career SES civilian employee for last move home.  Authorization for NTS must be stated in the PCS order.</p><p></p><p>A.  NTS of HHG for Duty at an Isolated PDS in the CONUS.  A civilian employee who performs PCS travel or new appointee travel to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is eligible for NTS of HHG.  The Transportation Officer determines the NTS location.  Justified requests for NTS on a PCS order to a PDS at an isolated location should be submitted to the official designated by the Service or Agency for a decision.</p><p></p><p>1.  Service Agreement.  Expenses for NTS of HHG at Government expense may be authorized for a civilian employee transferring to or within the CONUS when the civilian employee agrees, in writing, to remain in Government service for 12 months, beginning the date the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS.  This requirement may only be waived if the civilian employee is separated for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the Service or Agency concerned.  If the civilian employee violates the written service agreement, including failure to report for duty at the new PDS, any Government funds spent for NTS become the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  Follow finance regulations to recover funds due to the Government. </p><p></p><p>2.  Designated Isolated PDS.  An official designated by the Service or Agency must determine, on a case-by-case basis, that the location is a designated isolated PDS to authorize NTS of HHG.  A civilian employee assigned to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS is not allowed NTS of HHG when available housing at the PDS can accommodate the HHG, adequate housing is available within daily commuting distance, or when it is for the civilian employee’s convenience.  An AO may subsequently approve NTS for a PCS to a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS for the conversion of HHG in SIT to NTS or the conversion of storage at personal expense to that at Government expense.  An eligible civilian employee or new appointee may be authorized subsequent NTS to have an HHG portion transported to the isolated PDS and the remainder stored at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>3.  Time Limit.  NTS at Government expense may be authorized for the duration of the civilian employee’s assignment, but no longer than 3 years at a designated isolated PDS in the CONUS.  However, the appropriate authority must periodically review current housing conditions at the isolated official location to determine if it warrants continued storage.  Eligibility for NTS at Government expense ends on the last day of work at the isolated official location if that is before the end of the 3-year period.  Otherwise, eligibility for NTS at Government expense ends at 3 years or on the civilian employee’s last day of work at the isolated official location, whichever occurs first.  When the eligibility period ends on the last day of work at the designated isolated PDS in the CONUS, NTS at Government expense may continue until the beginning of the 2nd month after the month the civilian employee’s eligibility ends.  To avoid inequity, the civilian employee’s command may extend the NTS period for 89 or fewer days after the civilian employee’s last day of work or the NTS eligibility-period termination.  See examples on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p>4.  Allowable Costs.  NTS includes necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, transportation to and from the storage location, storage, and other directly related services necessary to place the HHG in the designated storage facility. </p><p></p><p>5.  Documentation.  The Transportation Officer prepares a DD Form 1164 (Service Order for Personal Property) in accordance with the DTR, showing the HHG weight and date it was placed in NTS.</p><p></p><p>B.  NTS of HHG for Moves to and between Areas OCONUS.  The conversion of HHG from SIT to NTS at Government expense and from storage at personal expense to NTS at Government expense may be authorized or approved in this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility for NTS.  At least one of the following must be true for a civilian employee to be eligible for NTS:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee is not authorized to transport HHG to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee is unable to use HHG at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>c.  Storage is in the Government’s best interest.</p><p></p><p>d.  Estimated storage cost would be less than the HHG round-trip transportation cost, including SIT, to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Time Limitation.  NTS at Government expense may be authorized for each tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS where the civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements.  Eligibility ends on the last day of work at the PDS.  When a civilian employee is no longer eligible for NTS, HHG may remain in NTS until the beginning of the 2nd month after the month that eligibility ends.  The losing command OCONUS may extend NTS at Government expense for up to 30 days before the tour of duty begins and up to 60 days after the last day of work at the PDS, limited to a total of 90 days.  The civilian employee’s losing command OCONUS must notify the Transportation Officer at the new PDS when the civilian employee’s eligibility for NTS ends.  See the DTMO website for examples.</p><p></p><p>3.  Record Keeping </p><p></p><p>a.  When HHG is placed in NTS at Government expense, the Transportation Officer storing the HHG must provide one copy of the completed DD Form 1164 (Service Order for Personal Property) and any amendments, with the original warehouse inventory receipt, to both the civilian employee at his or her address OCONUS and the personnel office OCONUS servicing the civilian employee’s PDS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The gaining personnel office OCONUS must establish a civilian employee NTS HHG file that is separate from official personnel records and serves as a suspense file for fiscal-year funding and any subsequent HHG transportation.  If the civilian employee is reassigned to another PDS OCONUS, the file must be forwarded with the civilian employee’s official personnel records.  The gaining personnel office OCONUS also must furnish the fiscal-year fund citation to the Transportation Officer, inform the Transportation Officer if the civilian employee’s NTS authority stops for any reason, and destroy the NTS file within a reasonable time after the civilian employee’s PCS to the CONUS.  The forms and procedures used for uniformed members may be used for a civilian employee’s NTS as long as those forms and procedures are consistent with provisions in this Chapter.</p><p></p><p>4.  Removing HHG from NTS</p><p></p><p>a.  A civilian employee whose HHG is in NTS at Government expense may withdraw all or any portion of the authorized HHG weight allowance from storage as long as the HHG is for a civilian employee or dependent’s use in establishing or enlarging a residence.  When a civilian employee’s HHG is in NTS because there is no authority to transport it or he or she cannot use HHG at a PDS OCONUS, then he or she may request to withdraw HHG from NTS and transport it at Government expense if the situation requiring the NTS no longer exists and the civilian employee needs the HHG for either the current tour of duty or because he or she signs a renewal agreement. </p><p></p><p>b.  The Government is responsible for all costs for withdrawal, drayage, unpacking, and uncrating, as long as the HHG delivery place is in the commuting area of the civilian employee’s actual residence and the JTR authorizes return transportation.  HHG transportation is the civilian employee’s financial responsibility when HHG is removed from NTS before the civilian employee has eligibility for return transportation or for reasons other than for early return of a dependent (see par. 053805).  When the civilian employee earns return transportation at Government expense, reimbursement for the HHG withdrawal expense must not be more than the drayage cost and related charges that would have been incurred at the time the civilian employee became eligible for return transportation at Government expense.  No further transportation or storage of the withdrawn HHG is authorized at Government expense before receiving a new PCS order. </p><p></p><p>C.  NTS of HHG for a DoD Dependents Schools (DoDDS) Civilian Employee</p><p></p><p>1.  Storage between School Years.  A DoDDS civilian employee separated from the rolls during the summer recess is not authorized NTS of HHG.  NTS between school years may be authorized for a DoDDS civilian employee on a school-year basis under all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  The DoDDS civilian employee is employed at the close of a school year and agrees, in writing, to teach the next school year.  If the DoDDS civilian employee does not report for duty at the next school year, then he or she is financially responsible for commercial storage costs (including related services) or value of the storage furnished (including related services) if the HHG was stored in a Government facility.  If the employing activity determines that the DoDDS civilian employee’s failure to report for duty was beyond the civilian employee’s control, the civilian employee is not financially responsible for those costs.</p><p></p><p>b.  The storage period is for a minimum of 1 month and is limited to the recess period between the 2 school years.</p><p></p><p>c.  The DoDDS civilian employee meets the eligibility requirements for NTS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Storage is instead of any of the following: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Government quarters occupancy.</p><p></p><p>(2)  A quarters allowance (20 U.S.C. §905).</p><p></p><p>(3)  Any other HHG storage that the DoDDS civilian employee is authorized by the JTR due to other employment in another position during any recess period between school years.</p><p></p><p>2.  Storage during DoDDS Civilian Employee Extended Leave.  An AO may authorize or approve NTS of HHG, limited to the applicable weight allowance, during extended leave if it is in the Government’s interest.  The storage is limited to 12 months for a DoDDS civilian employee on an authorized extended leave of absence in a leave status, with or without pay to attend an accredited college or university as part of renewal agreement travel.  An AO can authorize storage for an administrator as long as the period in the current agreement is completed rather than the 2 school years in par. 055011.  An AO can rescind authorization for NTS if the DoDDS civilian employee does not report for duty at the PDS OCONUS when leave without pay ends or does not present satisfactory evidence of course of study completion.  If the AO rescinds authorization for NTS, the costs become the DoDDS civilian employee’s financial responsibility, unless the AO determines that the situation was beyond the civilian employee’s control. </p><p></p><p>D.  NTS Converted to SIT.  If the Service or Agency concerned authorizes and approves, HHG may be converted from NTS to SIT, in whole or in part, if the civilian employee requests the conversion and is authorized transportation and NTS in the civilian employee’s order.  The conversion is of NTS to SIT is at Government expense.  However, any SIT storage costs accruing for longer than 180 days are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  Unless otherwise provided in par. 054307-B, no additional HHG storage, after conversion from NTS to SIT, is authorized before another PCS order is issued. </p><p>054307.  Storage in Transit (SIT) (FTR §302-7)</p><p></p><p>SIT is short-term storage that is part of HHG transportation.  It may be at any combination of the origin, destination, and en route locations with the Service or Agency’s approval.  SIT reimbursement is limited to the civilian employee’s actual storage costs.  The cost of removing HHG from SIT for delivery to temporary lodging is a TQSE expense.  SIT is not authorized for local HHG moves when no PCS exists. </p><p>A.  Time Limits.  The maximum total time limit for SIT is in Table 5-91.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-91.  Total Days Authorized for HHG SIT</p><p>Location</p><p>Initial SIT Authorized</p><p>Maximum SIT Authorized </p><p>1</p><p>CONUS to CONUS</p><p>60</p><p>150</p><p>2</p><p>CONUS to OCONUS</p><p>90</p><p>180</p><p>3</p><p>OCONUS to CONUS</p><p>90</p><p>180</p><p></p><p>1.  If additional storage is not authorized or approved, the civilian employee is financially responsible for additional storage expense.</p><p></p><p>2.  If an extension to the SIT time period is required, the civilian employee must submit a written request for a SIT extension to a Service- or Agency-designated official.  The Service or Agency official may authorize or approve an extension for up to 90 days due to any of the following factors:</p><p></p><p>a.  Serious illness of the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>b.  Serious illness or death of a dependent.</p><p></p><p>c.  An intervening TDY order or long-term training assignment.</p><p></p><p>d.  Lack of suitable civilian housing.</p><p></p><p>e.  Awaiting completion of residence under construction or renovation.</p><p></p><p>f.  Acts of God, national or natural disaster, or terrorism.</p><p></p><p>g.  Other validated circumstances beyond the civilian employee’s control, which the Service or Agency determines to be in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>B.  Additional Extensions for SIT.  Only PDTATAC may authorize or approve extensions of the SIT limits in Table 5-91.  Under no circumstances may a Service or Agency authorize or approve SIT beyond those limits.  SIT beyond the time limitations is not authorized under a TCS order.  PDTATAC will consider the merits of individual requests, on a case-by-case basis, for DoD civilian employees who relocated and encountered unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, such as a PCS that is interrupted by en route TDY.  PDTATAC will not authorize extensions except under the circumstances in this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>1.  Authority.  A GSA Waiver Memo, dated March 30, 2017, assigns PDTATAC the authority to grant the waiver for the time limits and extended this authority to March 31, 2020.  The Service or Agency must ensure the extension request to PDTATAC is in the Government’s interest and is not for the civilian employee’s personal convenience.</p><p></p><p>2.  Eligibility.  The eligibility criteria for consideration of SIT authorization and approval are for any of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Serious illness or death of a civilian employee or dependent.</p><p></p><p>b.  A long-term TDY deployment or training assignment.</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG transportation delays caused by embargos.</p><p></p><p>d.  Acts of God, national or natural disaster, or terrorism. </p><p></p><p>e.  Other validated circumstances that are beyond the civilian employee’s control when the Service or Agency determines SIT is in the Government’s interest and establishes that if SIT were not extended, would grossly burden the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>3.  Time Limitations.  The PDTATAC may authorize or approve extensions of the SIT period for no more than a total of 365 days.  All travel and transportation must be completed within 1 year from the civilian employee’s death, transfer, or appointment effective date unless a further extension is authorized under par. 053712. </p><p></p><p>4.  Documentation.  The civilian employee’s DoD Component or command must submit an extension request to PDTATAC for determination.  The DoD Component or command must include its request memo, copies of any TDY and PCS orders, and the previous second 90-day authorization and approval by its designated official.  The request memo must indicate the reason for SIT beyond the limit (and the scheduled TDY duration when TDY is involved) and the additional number of days the civilian employee requires.</p><p></p><p>5.  Submission Process.  The civilian employee’s DoD Component or command should submit the extension request through the Service’s or DoD Component’s civilian Advisory Panel (CAP) member.  The CAP member’s contact information is available in the Feedback Reporting section of the Introduction to the JTR or at PDTATAC Contact Information.</p><p></p><p>C.  HHG Partial Lot Withdrawal and Delivery from SIT.  HHG may be transported and stored in multiple lots.  The maximum HHG weight allowance is based upon shipping and storing all HHG as one lot.  If the civilian employee removes items from storage, and the carrier bills the Government for that removal, he or she is financially responsible for any excess cost to the Government.</p><p></p><p>D.  Funds Advance.  To receive an advance under the allowed commuted rate method, the civilian employee must provide a copy of a cost estimate from a commercial HHG carrier or a written statement that includes the origin and destination.  He or she must also provide a signed copy of a commercial bill of lading or other evidence of actual weight or a reasonable weight estimate acceptable to the DoD Component concerned and the anticipated period of storage at Government expense, limited to 90 days.</p><p></p><p>054308.  HHG Between Local Residences</p><p></p><p>Local transportation of a civilian employee’s HHG is authorized when, for the Government’s convenience, the local commander issues a written order to the civilian employee directing a change in residence between any two dwellings.  This authority must not be used for HHG transportation between private dwellings for an authorized PCS.  SIT is not authorized.  Local transportation costs are charged to the command ordering the transportation.  If the civilian employee’s HHG shipment is greater than the maximum amount authorized, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the excess cost.  If an adequate scale is not available, the excess weight is determined by using the constructed weight in Table 5-87.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>054309.  Professional Books, Papers, and Equipment (PBP&amp;E) </p><p>PBP&amp;E is HHG and part of the PCS weight allowance.  A POV may not be shipped as PBP&amp;E (FTR §302-9).  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  If it is determined before transportation that the PBP&amp;E may cause a civilian employee to exceed the authorized weight allowance, then instead of being moved as an HHG transportation expense, PBP&amp;E may be moved as an administrative expense under the following conditions: (FTR §302-7)  </p><p></p><p>1.  An official designated by the order-issuing command must review an itemized PBP&amp;E inventory before shipment occurs.</p><p></p><p>2.  The order-issuing command must determine that information furnished confirms that transporting the itemized materials as part of the HHG transportation would exceed the authorized weight allowance.</p><p></p><p>3.  An appropriate official designated by the order-issuing command at the new PDS must review and certify that the items listed in the PBP&amp;E are necessary for the proper performance of the civilian employee’s duties at the new PDS.  He or she must also determine that, if these items were not transported to the new PDS, the same or similar items would have to be procured at Government expense for the civilian employee’s use at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Weight Limitations.  The maximum weight allowance for shipment of PBP&amp;E is 2,000 pounds net weight.  This limitation is not subject to waiver and is effective May 1, 2014.  A civilian employee may exceed the maximum weight limit when returning from OCONUS or executing RAT if a transportation agreement to the location OCONUS was made before May 1, 2014.  HHG with PBP&amp;E greater than 2,000 pounds must have been originally shipped at Government expense to the location OCONUS.  The Government’s obligation to return HHG with PBP&amp;E is limited to the amount of HHG with PBP&amp;E initially authorized to be shipped OCONUS, including when the amount is greater than 2,000 pounds.  Once the civilian employee’s HHG returns to the CONUS, there is no authorization or waiver authority over the maximum weight on a subsequent transportation agreement.</p><p></p><p>C.  PBP&amp;E Shipped as an Administrative Expense.  When PBP&amp;E is authorized for shipment as an administrative expense, the transportation cost is not chargeable to travel-and-transportation-expense appropriations.  Transportation must be by the Actual Expense method in the CONUS and the commuted rate method is not authorized (FTR §302-7).  The PBP&amp;E weight and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be itemized on the documentation used to transport the PBP&amp;E.  A constructed weight may be used in unusual instances when it is not practicable or it is impossible to obtain the specific PBP&amp;E weight in Table 5-87.  The PBP&amp;E may be returned as an administrative expense to any location, limited to the constructed cost to the civilian employee’s actual residence when a civilian employee is separating from Government service provided the PBP&amp;E were transported to the location OCONUS as an administrative expense (FTR §302-7).</p><p></p><p>D.  Administratively Restricted HHG Weight.  When a civilian employee is assigned to an administratively weight-restricted PDS OCONUS, PBP&amp;E shipment is authorized as an administrative expense.  The PBP&amp;E weight allowance, when shipped as an administrative expense, is in addition to the restricted-weight allowance to a PDS OCONUS.  If the PBP&amp;E is not authorized to be shipped as an administrative expense, then it is considered part of the authorized PCS weight allowance. </p><p></p><p>054310.  Consumable Goods (FTR §300-3)</p><p>A civilian employee assigned to a PDS OCONUS location designated in Consumable Goods Allowance is authorized transportation of consumable goods in addition to the 4,500-pound HHG net weight allowance.  The consumable goods must be for the civilian employee’s or dependent’s personal use.  Consumable goods are transported like HHG with the same authorized originating location.  In unusual circumstances, such as a PCS from another PDS OCONUS designated on the DTMO website, an alternate shipping origin for consumable goods may be authorized through the Secretarial Process.  The total weight of HHG transported, plus HHG placed in NTS and any consumable goods transported that are chargeable to travel and transportation appropriations, is limited to the maximum authorized weight allowance.  The civilian employee’s PCS order must identify the consumable goods’ weight allowance and any alternate shipping origin authorized.  See Consumable Goods Allowance for additional information about shipment of consumable goods.</p><p></p><p>0544  MOBILE HOME TRANSPORTATION</p><p></p><p>The constructed cost to transport a mobile home, any HHG removed from the mobile home, and unaccompanied baggage and additional HHG to the new PDS for the civilian employee’s use is limited to the Government’s “Best Value” cost of the civilian employee’s maximum PCS HHG weight allowance between authorized points.  For details see DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value).  Transportation includes packing, pickup, line-haul or drayage, delivery, and unpacking.  A civilian employee may not receive reimbursement above what the Government would incur for HHG transportation and 90 days of HHG SIT (FTR §302-10). </p><p></p><p>054401.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee, authorized HHG transportation at Government expense, may be authorized mobile home-transportation allowances instead of HHG transportation, when all of the following conditions apply:</p><p></p><p>A.  The civilian employee acquires the mobile home on or before his or her PCS or TCS order’s effective date.</p><p></p><p>B.  The civilian employee certifies that he or she, or a dependent, intends to use the mobile home as a primary residence at the location where it is being moved.</p><p></p><p>C.  The mobile home body and chassis, including tires and tubes, are in fit condition to the Government’s satisfaction to withstand the transportation rigors.  Any costs involved to bring the mobile home into fit condition are at the civilian employee’s, the dependent’s, or heir’s expense.</p><p></p><p>D.  The civilian employee is ordered on a PCS or TCS between authorized locations (see par. 054404). </p><p></p><p>054402.  Transportation at Personal Expense</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee, or a deceased civilian employee’s dependent or heir, authorized mobile home allowances in par. 054401 may transport a mobile home at personal expense and be reimbursed for transportation costs according to this Part.  The civilian employee is responsible for making all transportation arrangements for personally procured mobile home transportation.  The allowances in par. 054405 apply to the respective transportation portions if a mobile home is transported partly by commercial transporter and partly by other means.  </p><p>054403.  Geographic Limitations</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee, a deceased civilian employee’s dependent, or an heir may only be authorized mobile home transportation allowances between the geographic locations in Table 5-92.  When the transportation includes locations other than those in Table 5-92, the allowances are computed based on the transportation portions for the locations listed in Table 5-92.  Mobile home transportation is limited to the Government’s “Best Value” cost to transport the maximum HHG weight between the old PDS and new PDS plus 90 days of HHG SIT.  A civilian employee may not use unused mobile home-transportation costs to ship HHG.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-92.  Geographic Limitations for Mobile Home Transportation Allowances</p><p>Locations</p><p>Defined Areas</p><p>1</p><p>Origin and Destination Points </p><p>a.  Within the CONUS.</p><p>b.  Within Alaska.</p><p>c.  Between the CONUS and Alaska.</p><p>d.  Through Canada en route between the CONUS and Alaska.</p><p>e.  Through Canada en route between one point in the CONUS and another, such as traveling from Buffalo, New York, to Detroit, Michigan.</p><p>f.  From the old PDS in the CONUS or in Alaska to a border crossing point or appropriate port.</p><p>g.  From a border crossing point or appropriate port in the CONUS to a new PDS in the CONUS or in Alaska.</p><p>h.  From a border crossing point or appropriate port in Alaska to a new PDS in Alaska.</p><p>2</p><p>Appropriate Port </p><p>A port within CONUS or Alaska ordinarily used when a mobile home is transported at personal expense between a port in the CONUS or Alaska and a PDS neither in the CONUS nor Alaska.</p><p>3</p><p>Border Crossing Point</p><p>A border crossing point ordinarily used for mobile home movement between the CONUS, or Alaska, and either Canada or Mexico.</p><p></p><p>054404.  Combining Weight Allowances </p><p></p><p>Whenever a civilian employee combines weight allowances with his or her spouse or domestic partner, only 90 days of storage of the combined weight may be included in the Government’s constructed-cost calculation.</p><p></p><p>A.  Civilian Employee Married to, or a Domestic Partner of, another Civilian Employee.  When both spouses or domestic partners are civilian employees, and each has a separate PCS order, they may combine their PCS HHG weight allowances to determine the Government’s cost liability to transport their mobile home.</p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employee Married to, or a Domestic Partner of, a Service Member.  When one spouse or domestic partner is a civilian employee and the other is a Service member, and each has a separate PCS order, they may combine their PCS HHG weight allowances to determine the Government’s cost liability to transport their mobile home. </p><p></p><p>054405.  Reimbursement of Costs for Personally Procured Commercial Transportation</p><p></p><p>When paying the carrier, the civilian employee or dependent (or heir if the civilian employee is deceased) ensures that the transporter’s bill or invoice includes an itemized list of charges.  He or she must ensure that the carrier’s preparation responsibility is clear, making any remaining preparations the responsibility of the civilian employee, dependent, or heir (if the civilian employee is deceased).  The body, frame, springs, wheels, brakes, and tires of the mobile home must be in a fit condition to permit transportation and any extra property placed in the mobile home must not create an overload condition that could result in damage and repair charges.  Any additional charges caused by overloading would be the financial responsibility of the civilian employee, dependent, or heir (if the civilian employee is deceased).  Reimbursement is in Table 5-93, limited to the costs allowed in this Part.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-93.  Transportation Costs for Personally Procured Commercial</p><p>1</p><p>Allowed</p><p>a.  Actual mobile home transportation, limited to the applicable tariff for such movements approved by an appropriate regulatory body, provided any substantial deviation from the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD)is explained. </p><p>b.  Mobile home preparation fees at an origin in the CONUS or Alaska for transportation or resettling at the destination in the CONUS or Alaska (see par. 054406-A).</p><p>c.  Taxes, charges, or fees fixed by a municipal authority for permits to transport mobile homes in or through its jurisdiction and carrier service charges for obtaining such permits.</p><p>d.  Pilot, flag car, or escort services, if required by law.</p><p>e.  Ferry fares, and bridge, road, and tunnel tolls.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Allowed</p><p>a.  The carrier’s maintenance or repair charges to the mobile home en route, including structural repairs, brake repairs, tire replacement, and incidental charges.</p><p>b.  Insurance or excess valuation costs over the carrier’s maximum liability, or charges designated in the tariffs as “Special Service.”</p><p>c.  Costs of connecting or disconnecting appliances, equipment, and utilities involved in relocation and of converting appliances for operation on available utilities. </p><p>d.  Special handling costs requested by the employee.</p><p>e.  Storage.</p><p></p><p>054406.  Reimbursement of Costs for Personally Procured Transportation not Using a Commercial Transporter</p><p></p><p>Reimbursement is for actual transportation, subject to the limitations in this Part.  If the origin or destination is neither in the CONUS nor in Alaska, the allowable distance is limited to the distance the mobile home is transported between authorized locations.  Use the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD)to compute the distance (see par. 020204).  If the origin or destination is an island within the CONUS or within Alaska, the statute distance to or from the usual place of arrival or departure on the mainland is allowed.  Reimbursement for a civilian employee is limited to what the Government would have incurred for HHG transportation and 90 days of HHG SIT, including when the civilian employee moves the mobile home by overland towing or drives it overland or over water.  Reimbursement is not authorized for preparation of mobile homes located OCONUS or outside Alaska for transportation or resettling OCONUS or outside Alaska.</p><p></p><p>A.  Preparation Costs Allowed.  The Service or Agency concerned pays the transportation preparation and resettling costs at the destination.  Allowable preparation costs include: </p><p></p><p>1.  Rental, installation, removal, or transportation of hitches and extra axles with wheels or tires.</p><p></p><p>2.  Blocking and unblocking, including anchoring and un-anchoring, labor costs at the origin or destination.</p><p></p><p>3.  Blocks purchased instead of transporting blocks from the old PDS and the cost of replacement blocks broken while the mobile home was being transported.</p><p></p><p>4.  HHG packing and unpacking associated with the mobile home.</p><p></p><p>5.  Disconnecting and connecting utilities.</p><p></p><p>6.  Skirting removal and installation labor costs.</p><p></p><p>7.  Movement and reassembling costs of separating, preparing, and sealing each half of a doublewide mobile home.</p><p></p><p>8.  Trailer towing lights installation or removal.</p><p></p><p>9.  Extension costs of existing water and sewer lines.</p><p></p><p>10.  Dismantling and assembling costs for a portable room appended to a mobile home.</p><p></p><p>11.  Costs for expanding, stabilizing, and sealing room-expansion sections in a single-wide mobile home, also known as expando charges.</p><p></p><p>12.  Transportation expenses, such as anti-sway device charges over-dimension charges and permits, and wrecker service when required.</p><p></p><p>13.  Travel lift fees.</p><p></p><p>14.  Similar expenses.</p><p></p><p>B.  Mobile Home Towed by POV.  When a POV tows a mobile home, a mileage allowance of $0.11 a mile is paid to cover the costs of transporting the mobile home for the expenses allowed in Table 5-93.  Additionally, a POV PCS mileage allowance for transportation of authorized travelers is paid.  See mileage rates.  Use the Defense Table of Official Distances (DTOD)to determine the official distance.  The Service or Agency concerned pays the transportation preparation and resettling costs at the destination (FTR §302-10). </p><p></p><p>C.  Over-Water Transportation of a Boat Used as a Primary Residence (House Boat).  Over-water mobile home transportation is authorized only for transportation from and to points in the CONUS or in Alaska.  When a civilian employee transports a boat used as a primary residence over water and chooses actual expense reimbursement, the following transportation costs are authorized:</p><p></p><p>1.  Fuel or oil used for propulsion of the boat.</p><p></p><p>2.  Pilots or navigators in the open water.</p><p></p><p>3.  A crew.</p><p></p><p>4.  Harbor pilot charges.</p><p></p><p>5.  Docking fees incurred in transit.</p><p></p><p>6.  Harbor or port fees and similar charges related to entry in and navigation through ports.</p><p></p><p>7.  Towing (in tow or towing by pushing from behind). </p><p></p><p>8.  Similar expenses.</p><p></p><p>D.  Self-Propelled Mobile Home.  The civilian employee may choose whether to be reimbursed for actual expense or for mileage.  When the civilian employee chooses reimbursement for mileage, reimbursement for a self-propelled mobile home, whether driven over water or land, is at the automobile mileage rate (see par. 020210 and mileage rates) for the official distance between the authorized points.  Reimbursement is for the actual transportation costs (see Table 5-93 and par. 054406-A).  Reimbursement by either method is limited to what the Government would incur for HHG transportation and 90 days of HHG SIT and must follow DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Chapter 403 (Best Value). </p><p></p><p>054407.  Funds Advance</p><p></p><p>The civilian employee may receive an advance of mobile home transportation allowances when he or she personally procures transportation, including necessary incidental expenses, using a commercial carrier.  The funds advance is limited to the estimated allowable amount.  An advance is not authorized when the Government pays the carrier directly. </p><p></p><p>054408.  Government-Procured Transportation </p><p></p><p>When the Government arranges the civilian employee’s mobile home transportation by commercial or Government means to or from the points authorized, it pays all transportation costs up to what it would have cost to transport the civilian employee’s PCS HHG weight allowance from the old PDS to the new PDS.  These costs include pickup, transportation, and delivery of the mobile home to the destination ready for occupancy.  The civilian employee, dependent, or heir must sign a written agreement accepting financial responsibility for all excess costs.  This includes any excess preparation, transportation, or expense charges; excess distance charges; excess HHG charges; and other costs not allowed in this paragraph.  When the civilian employee will no longer be in a pay status following mobile home transportation and excess costs are not collectable, the civilian employee’s repayment request must be denied.  The civilian employee may not receive any other allowances for the transportation involved and may not transport any HHG separately at Government expense.  Expenses for transporting a mobile home at Government expense are limited to the usual highway routing in the CONUS or Alaska, and through Canada between the origin and the destination in the CONUS or Alaska.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-94.  Transportation Costs for Government-Procured Transportation</p><p>1</p><p>Allowed</p><p>a.  Actual transportation.</p><p>b.  Ferry fares.</p><p>c.  Bridge, road, and tunnel tolls.</p><p>d.  Taxes.</p><p>e.  Municipal, state, or local permits.</p><p>f.  Preparations fees (see par. 054406-A).</p><p>2</p><p>Not Allowed</p><p>a.  Damage or repair due to an overload condition.*</p><p>b.  Special handling requested by the civilian employee.</p><p>c.  Insurance or excess valuation over the carrier’s maximum liability.</p><p>d.  Body or chassis mobile home preparation.</p><p>e.  Repairs or maintenance performed en route, including structural repairs, brake repairs, and parts or tire replacement.</p><p>f.  Storage accruing at any point, unless caused by conditions beyond the civilian employee’s control.</p><p>g.  Connecting or disconnecting appliances, equipment, and utilities involved in relocation and of converting appliances for operation on available utilities.</p><p>*The civilian employee must ensure that body, frame, springs, wheels, brakes, and tires are in good condition and that any extra property placed in the mobile home does not create an overload condition that could result in damage or repair charges.</p><p></p><p>054409.  Civilian Employee Death</p><p></p><p>A.  CONUS.  If a civilian employee dies en route or he or she had reported to the new PDS, the civilian employee’s mobile home is moved at Government expense in accordance with the rules for HHG shipment in par. 054812.  If the civilian employee was located at a PDS in the CONUS and the dependent is at that PDS, the Government will not pay to move the mobile home for the dependent or heir.</p><p></p><p>B.  OCONUS.  If a civilian employee dies while located OCONUS, the Government will move a mobile home left behind in the CONUS for the dependent or heir to the civilian employee’s actual residence or an alternate destination.  The allowable expenses are limited to the cost of transportation to the civilian employee’s actual residence.  Travel and transportation must begin within 1 year from the date of the civilian employee’s death.  A 1-year extension may be granted if requested by the family or heir before the expiration of the 1-year limit.</p><p></p><p>0545  REAL ESTATE ALLOWANCES</p><p></p><p>An eligible civilian employee is authorized reimbursement for certain expenses incurred for the sale of a residence, the settlement of an unexpired lease on a residence, the settlement of an unexpired lease on a lot on which a mobile home used as a residence was located at the old PDS, or the purchase (including construction) of a residence at the new PDS.  These types of events are referred to as “residence transactions.”  Real estate allowances may be authorized after the civilian employee has signed the required service agreement and met the requirements in this section.  A civilian employee may not receive an advance for residence-transactions expenses.</p><p></p><p>054501.  Requirements for Reimbursement of Residence Transactions </p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A PCS must be authorized or approved to receive reimbursement for expenses.  The old PDS and new PDS must be located in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS, except as specified in par. 054502.  The dwelling at the old PDS must be the civilian employee’s actual residence when he or she is informed of a definite transfer to a new PDS.  The residence is the place from which the civilian employee regularly commutes to and from work on a daily basis.  Weekend travel does not qualify.  The residence may be a mobile home or the lot where that mobile home is located or will be located.  It includes the dwelling where a civilian employee’s dependent resides or will reside if the PDS is in a remote area where adequate family housing is not available within reasonable commuting distance.  The AO must determine that the residence reasonably relates to the PDS.  For a civilian employee transferring from a foreign PDS, the new PDS is the location where the civilian employee reports for duty when reassigned or transferred from a foreign area.  The following individuals are ineligible for reimbursement of residence transactions:</p><p></p><p>1.  A new appointee assigned to a first PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee transferred from or to a foreign PDS, except for a civilian employee eligible for reimbursement of residence transaction expenses under par. 054502.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee at a training location who is authorized dependent and HHG transportation to or from the training location when such transportation is authorized instead of per diem or actual expense allowances under the provisions of section 0326.</p><p></p><p>4.  A civilian employee, assigned to a post of duty OCONUS, returning for separation.</p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee performing RAT and whose return to a different non-foreign PDS OCONUS does not meet the short-distance transfer requirements in par. 054802 from the old PDS to the new PDS, which are both in a non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>6.  A civilian employee hired locally at a location in a foreign area upon transfer to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Time Limits.  The settlement dates for residential sale and purchase or lease termination must be within the time limitations in this paragraph.  The settlement for the sale, purchase, or lease termination transactions should be no later than 1 year after the civilian employee’s effective date of transfer.  The 1-year period begins when the civilian employee’s transfer becomes effective and ends on the first anniversary of that date.  The commanding officer or designee may extend the 1-year period for up to an additional year.  The civilian employee should submit a written request for a time extension to the appropriate authority within the initial 1-year period.  The commanding officer of the activity bearing the cost may, but is not required to, take action on a request submitted more than 30 calendar days after the initial 1-year expiration date.  An extension may be granted only if extenuating circumstances prevented the civilian employee from completing the residence transactions within the initial 1-year period and that the delayed transactions are reasonably related to the PCS.  Costs for transactions completed after the 2-year period may not be reimbursed.  There is no authority to waive the 2-year time limitation under any circumstances.  </p><p></p><p>C.  Title Requirements.  The title to the residence at the old PDS or new PDS, or the interest in a cooperatively owned dwelling or in an unexpired lease, must be in the civilian employee’s name alone, jointly in the names of the civilian employee and one or more dependents, or solely in the name of one or more dependents.  At the old PDS, the civilian employee must have acquired his or her property interest before the date he or she was officially notified of the transfer.  When par. 054502 applies, he or she must have acquired his or her interest in the residence at the old PDS before the date the civilian employee was officially notified of the foreign-area transfer.</p><p></p><p>D.  Determining Title to the Residence.  The name of the party or parties on the title document (for example, the deed) determine the title to the residence.  A civilian employee or dependent is deemed to have equitable title to the residence, whether or not named on the title document, as long as the property is the civilian employee’s residence as specified in par. 054501-A and any of the following conditions are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  Title Is Held in Trust.  The property is held in trust and meets all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee or dependent are the only trust beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee or dependent retain the right to distribute the property for life.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee or dependent retain the right to manage the property.</p><p></p><p>d.  The civilian employee or dependent is the only trust grantor or settler, or retains the right to direct property distribution upon trust dissolution or death.</p><p></p><p>e.  The civilian employee provides the DoD Component concerned with a copy of the trust document.</p><p></p><p>2.  Title Is Held by Financial Institution.  The title is held in the name of a financial institution and meets all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee or dependent executed a financing agreement (for example, mortgage) with the financial institution.</p><p></p><p>b.  The state or local law requires that lending parties take title to perfect or protect a security interest in the property, or the financial institution requires that it take possession of the title as a financing agreement condition.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee provides the DoD Component concerned with a copy of the financing document.  The DoD Component concerned may also require that the civilian employee provide proof of state or local laws governing secured credit.</p><p></p><p>3.  Title Includes a Cosigner.  An individual who signs a civilian employee’s financing agreement (for example, a mortgage) to lend a name (for example, credit) to the arrangement is often referred to as a “cosigner” on the financing agreement.  If the title is held both in the name of the civilian employee individually, or the civilian employee and one or more dependents jointly, or one or more dependents and a cosigner who is not a dependent and meets all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee or dependent has the right to use the property and to direct property distribution or transfer from one party to another.</p><p></p><p>b.  The lender requires the cosigner’s signature on the finance document.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee or dependent is liable for payments under the financing arrangement.</p><p></p><p>d.  The cosigner’s name is on the title.</p><p></p><p>e.  The cosigner’s does not have a financial interest in the property unless the civilian employee or dependent defaults on the financing arrangement.</p><p></p><p>f.  The civilian employee provides the DoD Component concerned with acceptable documentation.  The documentation may include a copy of the financing document or a written statement from the civilian employee certifying that the conditions in par. 054501-D3 apply.  The documentation also may include a written statement from the cosigner certifying no financial interest in the property and any other documentation that the DoD Component concerned may require.</p><p>4.  Title Is Held by Property Seller.  The property seller holds the title and meets all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee or dependent has the right to use the property and to direct property distribution or transfer from one party to another. </p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee or dependent signed a financing agreement (for example, a land contract) with the property seller providing for fixed periodic payments and title transfer to the civilian employee or dependent upon completion of the payment schedule.</p><p></p><p>c.  Civilian employee provides the DoD Component concerned with a copy of a financing agreement.</p><p></p><p>5.  Other Equitable Title Situations.  The title is held only in the civilian employee’s name or a dependent’s name, or jointly by the civilian employee and dependent.  The title also is held by an individual who is not a dependent.  In addition to these factors, all of the following conditions must be met:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee or dependent has the right to use the property and to direct distribution or transfer from one party to another. </p><p></p><p>b.  Only the civilian employee or dependent has made payments on the property.</p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee or dependent receives all proceeds from the property sale.</p><p></p><p>d.  The civilian employee provides documentation acceptable to the DoD Component that the above conditions have been met.  Supporting documentation must include financial documents proving that only the civilian employee or dependent made payments on the property, and that the civilian employee or dependent received all proceeds from the property sale.  The civilian employee must provide any other documentation required by the DoD Component concerned.</p><p></p><p>E.  Pro Rata Reimbursement.  A civilian employee is reimbursed only for expenses that he or she, or a dependent, actually incurred and paid.  If persons other than the civilian employee or dependent shared any expenses, reimbursement is limited to the portion actually paid by the civilian employee or dependent.  If a civilian employee or dependent share title to a residence with someone else, or if a civilian employee has equitable title interest under par. 054501-D, the civilian employee is reimbursed on a pro rata basis (proportional share) to the extent of his or her actual or deemed title interest in the residence.  Additionally, a civilian employee is reimbursed on a pro rata basis in the following situations:</p><p></p><p>1.  The residence is a duplex or other type of multiple occupancy dwelling that is occupied only partially by the civilian employee, or whenever the civilian employee shares responsibility for a leased property (for example, a shared apartment arrangement).</p><p></p><p>2.  A residence is bought or sold with more land than reasonably relates to the residence site.</p><p></p><p>F.  Property Management Services Selected and Subsequent Residence Sale.  A civilian employee who chooses property management services after the DoD Component offers them may later choose to sell the residence per par. 054504-B within the applicable time limitation and requirements for reimbursement.  The reimbursement, including the amount previously paid for property management services, is limited to the reimbursement limitations in par. 054504-F.  This authority does not extend to a civilian employee enrolled in the Home Sale Program or apply to property at a foreign location OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>054502.  Transfer from a Foreign PDS to a PDS in the CONUS or Non-Foreign PDS OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee who completes an agreed-upon tour of duty at a foreign PDS and is reassigned or transferred to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS is authorized reimbursement of costs for residence transactions.  All of the following conditions must apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  The new PDS is not the same PDS from which the civilian employee was reassigned or transferred to the OCONUS PDS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  The distance between the residence, the old PDS, and the new PDS must meet the criteria in par. 054802 for a short-distance transfer.  </p><p></p><p>c.  The civilian employee signs a service agreement to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee who was not initially a civilian employee and, after signing a service agreement in connection with a transfer from a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS to the foreign PDS, was moved to the foreign PDS at Government expense under a civilian PCS travel order is ineligible for real estate allowances.  The following people are also ineligible:</p><p></p><p>a.  A locally hired civilian employee in par. 054908 who meets any of these criteria:</p><p></p><p>(1)  Is a former member of the U.S. Armed Forces.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Is not a former member of the U.S. Armed Forces, unless the individual was a civilian employee of an Agency who was initially transferred from a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS to the foreign PDS.</p><p></p><p>(3)  Accompanied or followed the spouse to the area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>b.  A civilian employee hired in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS for assignment to a first PDS that is in a foreign area.</p><p></p><p>c.  A former civilian employee with a break in service who is rehired in the CONUS or in a non-foreign area OCONUS for assignment to a first PDS that is in a foreign area.</p><p></p><p>B.  Reimbursable Expenses</p><p></p><p>1.  Expenses incurred for a residence sale or the settlement of an unexpired lease at the PDS from which the civilian employee was transferred when assigned to a foreign PDS are reimbursable.  Expenses incurred for a residence purchase at the new PDS are also reimbursable.</p><p></p><p>2.  Expenses may not be reimbursed for a real estate transaction that occurs before the civilian employee officially receives notification, ordinarily in the form of a PCS travel order, that reassignment or transfer is to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p>054503.  Residence Sale in Anticipation of Transfer  </p><p></p><p>A.  Following Base-Closure Announcement.  A civilian employee is authorized reimbursement for real estate expenses incurred before, and in anticipation of, a transfer if administrative intent to transfer the civilian employee is evident when the expenses are incurred.  The announcement of a base closure, accompanied by an offer to assist in finding a new position for an affected civilian employee, is evidence of the intent to relocate.  Registering a civilian employee in the Priority Placement Program (PPP) constitutes an offer to assist in finding a new position.  A civilian employee, registered in the PPP or other placement program, who sells a residence in anticipation of a PCS is authorized reimbursement for residence sale expenses when transferred to a new PDS, if otherwise eligible.  Each civilian employee should be cautioned that eligibility for real estate expenses reimbursement exists only if the civilian employee is subsequently employed in a position that involves a PCS with a service agreement.  If the PCS is to a foreign area, reimbursement for the expenses may be made only after the civilian employee completes a tour of duty in the foreign area and a subsequent transfer to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS in par. 054502.</p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employee Officially Notified of Return to a Different PDS in the CONUS or Non-foreign Area OCONUS.  A civilian employee who is notified officially that his or her return will be to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS may sell the residence at the former PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS following receipt of official notification.  Reimbursement for real estate expenses must follow section 0545 upon completion of a tour of duty in the foreign area and subsequent transfer to a different PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS.  Each civilian employee should be cautioned of the following: </p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement is not allowed for any real estate transaction that occurs before official notification that the civilian employee’s return will be to a PDS other than the one from which transferred to the foreign PDS.  A travel order transferring the civilian employee from a foreign PDS to a PDS other than the one from which the civilian employee was transferred to the foreign PDS ordinarily constitutes official notification.</p><p></p><p>2.  Reimbursement must not be made until the civilian employee is transferred back to a PDS in the CONUS or in a non-foreign area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  Reimbursement must not be made for the transfer to the foreign-area PDS, even though the civilian employee is notified at that time that his or her return will not be to the same PDS after completing the foreign assignment.</p><p></p><p>4.  Reimbursement is not allowed for a civilian employee who returns to the actual residence for separation.</p><p></p><p>054504.  Allowable Reimbursable Expenses for Sale or Purchase of Residence </p><p></p><p>A.  Broker’s Fees or Real Estate Commission.  A broker’s fee or real estate commission for services in selling the residence is reimbursable, but limited to rates generally charged for such services in the old PDS locality.  No such fee or commission is reimbursable for the new PDS home purchase.</p><p></p><p>B.  Advertising and Selling Expenses.  Customary costs of appraisal and costs of newspaper, bulletin board, multiple-listing services, or other advertising for selling the residence at the old PDS are reimbursable if not included in a broker’s fee or real estate agent’s commission.</p><p></p><p>C.  Legal and Related Costs.  To the extent they are not included in broker’s fees or similar services reimbursed under other categories, the following expenses are reimbursable for selling a residence if customarily paid by the seller at the old PDS, and purchasing a residence if customarily paid by a purchaser at the new PDS.  Payable expenses are limited to the amounts customarily charged where the residence is located:</p><p></p><p>1.  Searching title, preparing abstract and legal fees for a title opinion, or where customarily furnished by the seller, the cost of a title insurance policy.</p><p></p><p>2.  Preparing conveyances, other instruments, and contracts.</p><p></p><p>3.  Related notary fees and recording fees.</p><p></p><p>4.  Making surveys and preparing drawings or plats when required for legal financing purposes.</p><p></p><p>5.  Special services when the transferred civilian employee is unable to physically attend settlement, and services were procured by the transferred civilian employee or someone working with the civilian employee (not the lender), and if the special services are necessary for reasons other than personal preference.  This includes a fee for courier delivery, or similar service, or the cost of preparing a power of attorney.</p><p></p><p>6.  When a single over-all legal fee is charged, that fee may be paid without itemization if it is within the customary range of residence transaction charges in that location.  Litigation costs are not reimbursable.</p><p>7.  Similar expenses.</p><p></p><p>D.  Miscellaneous Expenses.  The expenses listed below are reimbursable for selling a residence if customarily paid by a seller at the old PDS, or purchasing a residence if customarily paid by a buyer at the new PDS, within specifically stated limitations.  In the absence of limitations, amounts customarily paid in the location of the residence are reimbursable with the following appropriate supporting documentation provided by the civilian employee:</p><p></p><p>1.  FHA or VA fee for a loan application.</p><p></p><p>2.  Loan origination fees and similar charges, such as loan-assumption fees and loan-transfer fees.  Reimbursement for a loan assumption fee, a loan transfer fee, or a similar charge also may be allowed if it is assessed instead of a loan origination fee and reflects charges for services similar to those covered by a loan origination fee.  A civilian employee may be reimbursed for these fees limited to 1% of the loan amount without itemization of the lender’s administrative charges.  Reimbursement may be for more than 1% only if a civilian employee shows by clear and convincing evidence that the higher rate does not include prepaid interest, points, or a mortgage discount; and the higher rate is customarily charged in the location of the residence.</p><p></p><p>Note:  A loan origination fee is a fee paid by a borrower to compensate a lender for administrative-type expenses incurred in originating and processing a loan.  </p><p></p><p>3.  Cost of preparing credit reports.</p><p></p><p>4.  Mortgage and transfer taxes.</p><p>5.  State revenue stamps.</p><p></p><p>6.  Other fees and charges similar in nature to those listed above, unless specifically prohibited in par. 054505 below.</p><p></p><p>7.  Charge for prepayment of a mortgage or other security instrument for the sale of a residence at the old PDS to the extent the terms in the mortgage or other security instrument provide for this charge.  This prepayment penalty is also reimbursable when the mortgage or other security instrument does not specifically provide for prepayment, provided the lender customarily charges this penalty.  In this case, the reimbursement is limited to 3 months’ interest on the loan balance.</p><p></p><p>8.  Mortgage title insurance policy paid for by a civilian employee on a residence he or she purchased that is required by the lender.</p><p></p><p>9.  Owner’s title insurance policy, provided it is a prerequisite to financing or transferring property or the owner’s title insurance policy cost and is inseparable from the other insurance costs.</p><p></p><p>10.  Expenses for construction of a residence comparable to reimbursable expenses for the purchase of an existing residence.</p><p></p><p>11.  Expenses for environmental testing and property inspection fees when required by Federal, state, or local law, or by a lender as a precondition to sale or purchase.  Environmental protection fee if required as a condition of the mortgage.</p><p></p><p>E.  Incidental Expenses.  Incidental charges made for required services in selling and purchasing residences are reimbursable if they are customarily paid by a seller at the old PDS or if customarily paid by a purchaser at the new PDS, limited to amounts customarily charged in the location of the residence.</p><p></p><p>F.  Reimbursement Limit.  Total reimbursement is limited to 10% of the actual sale price of the residence at the old PDS and 5% of the purchase price of a residence at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>054505.  Non-Reimbursable Expenses for Sale or Purchase of a Residence </p><p>A.  General Non-Reimbursable Expenses.  Except as otherwise provided in par. 054504, the following expenses are not reimbursable:</p><p></p><p>1.  Owner’s title insurance policy, “record title” insurance policy, mortgage insurance or insurance against loss or damage of property, and optional insurance paid for by a civilian employee for the purchase of a residence at the civilian employee’s discretion.</p><p></p><p>2.  Interest on loans, points, and mortgage discounts.</p><p></p><p>3.  Property taxes.</p><p></p><p>4.  Operating or maintenance costs.</p><p></p><p>5.  No fee, cost, charge, or expense determined to be part of the finance charge under the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. §1601), and Regulation Z issued in 12 CFR §226, unless specifically authorized in par. 054504-D above.</p><p></p><p>6.  Expenses that result from residence construction that are not comparable to the expenses for purchasing an existing residence. </p><p></p><p>7.  VA funding fee.</p><p></p><p>B.  Losses Due to Prices or Market Conditions.  Losses may not be reimbursed when caused by failure to sell a residence at the old PDS at the price asked, at its current appraised value, or at its original cost.  Losses due to failure to buy a dwelling at the new PDS at a price comparable to the selling price of the residence at the old PDS, or any similar causes, also are not reimbursed.</p><p></p><p>054506.  Procedure and Claim Requirements for Sale or Purchase of Residence Reimbursement </p><p></p><p>A.  Application for Reimbursement of Expenses.  A civilian employee must prepare and submit DD Form 1705 (Reimbursement for Real Estate Sale and/or Purchase Closing Cost Expenses) to be reimbursed for expenses.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-95.  Required Supporting Documents for Real Estate Transactions</p><p>1</p><p>Selling a Residence</p><p>a.  Sales agreement. </p><p>b.  Mortgage document.  If a prepayment fee is claimed, the document must include the payment terms.</p><p>c.  Property settlement document and approved claim application if there has been a prior claim settlement for a residence purchase.</p><p>d.  Title document (for example, the deed) necessary to determine title to the residence as required in par. 054501-D.</p><p>e.  Paid invoices or receipts of $75 or more for each additional claimed expense item.</p><p>2</p><p>Purchasing a Residence</p><p>a.  Purchase agreement.</p><p>b.  Finance charge disclosure statement when provided by a lending institution in compliance with P.L. 90-321 (Consumer Credit Protection Act).c.  Property settlement document and approved claim application if there has been a prior claim settlement for a residence sale.</p><p>d.  Title document (for example, the deed) necessary to determine title to the residence as required in par. 054501-D.</p><p>e.  Paid invoices or receipts of $75 or more for each additional claimed expense item.</p><p>f.  Loan closing statement.</p><p></p><p>B.  Review and Approval of Reasonable Charges.</p><p></p><p>1.  An official designated by the commanding officer of an activity must review the expenses claimed and the supporting documentation.  The reviewing official must determine if the expenses claimed are reasonable in amount and customarily paid by the seller or buyer (as appropriate) in the location of the property.</p><p></p><p>a.  The reviewing official may use the service of available legal officers in determining whether any claimed item is an authorized real estate expense or a finance charge under the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. §1601).</p><p></p><p>b.  The local real estate association should be contacted for a schedule of typical closing costs for local single-family property purchases and sales.  The local real estate association also may provide information concerning local real estate transaction custom and practices, including information about which costs are paid by the buyer and which costs are paid by the seller.  These closing costs should be used as guidelines but not as rigid limitations in determining if the expenses claimed are reasonable.  </p><p></p><p>c.  The reviewing official must attach to DD Form 1705 an explanation regarding any disallowance, reduction, or adjustment of cost items.  Any portion of costs determined to be excessive, or for which a satisfactory explanation cannot be obtained, must not be approved.  For approved expense items, the reviewing official must indicate the authorized amount, sign DD Form 1705, and return the entire claim to the official from whom it was received at the civilian employee’s new duty location.</p><p></p><p>d.  If a reviewing official determines that the DD Form 1705 cannot be approved due to incomplete documentation, or other reasons, the reviewing official must return the claim with an explanatory letter to the official from whom it was received at the civilian employee’s new PDS.  </p><p></p><p>2.  The official at the new duty location must forward the claim to the appropriate payment official for payment approval if the claim was approved.  If the reviewing official determined a claim is not payable, the official at the new duty location must forward any attached explanatory letter to the civilian employee.  See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9, Chapter 6 (Permanent Duty Travel), for claim submission.</p><p></p><p>054507.  Allowable Reimbursable Expenses for an Unexpired Lease Settlement </p><p></p><p>A.  Conditions for Reimbursement.  Expenses, including broker’s fees for obtaining a sublease or charges for advertising an unexpired lease, incurred for settling an unexpired lease (including month-to-month rental) on a residence occupied by a civilian employee at the old PDS are reimbursable when all of the following conditions apply:</p><p></p><p>1.  Applicable laws or the lease terms provide for payment of settlement expenses.</p><p></p><p>2.  They cannot be avoided by subleasing or other arrangement.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee has not contributed to the expense, for example, by failing to give appropriate lease termination notice promptly after the civilian employee receives official notification of the date of transfer.</p><p></p><p>4.  The broker’s fees or advertising charges are limited to those customarily charged for comparable services in that locality.</p><p></p><p>B.  Claim Requirement.  A civilian employee must submit a claim following the directions in the DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy), for reimbursement of costs incurred for settlement of an unexpired lease.  Allowable cost items are limited to those payments made by the civilian employee that represent unavoidable expense directly attributable to lease termination before the expiration date.  The total expenses amount must be entered on the travel voucher.  The civilian employee must be prepared to provide the following documentation:</p><p></p><p>1.  A copy of the lease specifying penalties or other costs payable if occupancy is terminated before the lease expiration date.</p><p></p><p>2.  A statement of the extent of bona fide attempts made to avoid penalty costs if the lease includes a savings provision for subleasing or making other arrangements to avoid penalty costs.</p><p></p><p>3.  An itemization of expenses and necessary explanations for clarification of penalty costs and paid receipts for each expense item.</p><p></p><p>Note:  For authority to reimburse a civilian employee for a lease penalty expense incurred for early termination of a lease in connection with a transfer to or from a foreign area, see the DSSR.</p><p></p><p>0546  RELOCATION SERVICES</p><p></p><p>A DoD Component may offer relocation services to a civilian employee if he or she transfers from one PDS to another in the Government’s interest and signs a service agreement.  A service agreement is not required for property management services for a TCS (see par. 053714).  A transfer is not in the Government’s interest and relocation services are not authorized if the transfer is primarily for the civilian employee’s convenience or benefit or at the civilian employee’s request.  Applying for a vacancy announcement is considered in the Government’s interest.  Relocation services are not authorized for a new appointee, a civilian employee assigned under the Government Civilian Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. §4109), or a civilian employee assigned or transferred to or from a foreign PDS except when he or she is eligible for reimbursement of residence-transaction expenses and property management services in par. 054602.  If a civilian employee violates the service agreement terms, the Government may recover from the civilian employee all payments made on his or her behalf to the relocation company (see section 0549).  When relocation services are authorized, the civilian employee has the option to accept or decline such services.  </p><p></p><p>054601.  Acceptance of Relocation Services </p><p></p><p>When a civilian employee accepts relocation services, he or she may not be reimbursed for expenses authorized elsewhere in the JTR that are similar to those paid under the relocation services contract.</p><p></p><p>A.  Real Estate.  An eligible civilian employee must meet the title requirements in par. 054501-C.  If persons other than the civilian employee or dependent shared any expenses, payment is limited to the portion actually paid by the civilian employee or dependent.</p><p></p><p>B.  Travel Order.  Relocation services authorization must be on the original PCS order, even if contingent on circumstances, such as hardship situations after aggressive attempts to sell the home.  The funding activity may make an exception if a mandatory authorization, such as a move related to BRAC, was omitted inadvertently or through error when preparing the order.</p><p></p><p>C.  Relocation Services Responsibility for a Civilian Employee.  The Government will pay a relocation services company actual expenses incurred in connection with the purchase of a civilian employee’s home, limited to a maximum home value of $750,000.  The civilian employee is responsible for all additional costs for a home value above $750,000.  The funding activity may waive the maximum according to DoD Component regulations.</p><p></p><p>054602.  Property Management Services</p><p></p><p>Property management services are intended to reduce the Government’s relocation costs by using these services instead of real estate allowances.  Property management services also assist the civilian employee by offsetting costs associated with retaining a residence at the old PDS in the CONUS from which the civilian employee commuted daily to the old work location when transferred to duty locations OCONUS.  The services include obtaining a tenant, negotiating the lease, inspecting the property regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from rental proceeds or the civilian employee’s escrow funds, accounting for the transactions, providing periodic reports to the civilian employee.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  The civilian employee or a member of the civilian employee’s immediate family must hold title to a residence that he or she would be eligible to sell at Government expense to receive property management services.  New appointees, those assigned under the Government Civilian Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. §4109), and civilian employees transferring between foreign PDSs are ineligible for property management services.  Payment for property management services may be authorized in the following situations:</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee transfers in the Government’s interest to a foreign PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee returns to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS and all of the following have occurred:</p><p></p><p>a.  Civilian employee travel originated at a PDS in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>b.  Civilian employee completes his or her tour of duty at the foreign PDS.</p><p></p><p>c.  Civilian employee returns to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS other than the PDS he or she left before going to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>d.  The civilian employee is eligible to sell the residence at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee transfers within the United States, including to, from, or between non-foreign areas OCONUS, and is eligible to sell a residence with Government expense reimbursement.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  Property management services may be obtained under the DoD National Relocation Program contract or the civilian employee may hire a rental-agency service of his or her choice.</p><p></p><p>1.  Reimbursement is for standard property management fees, limited to 10% of the monthly rental amount or up to 10% of established monthly rental value. </p><p></p><p>2.  Relocations within a foreign area, or from one foreign area to a different foreign area, do not affect previously authorized property management services for a civilian employee’s residence as long as the civilian employee continues to meet the requirements of par. 054603.</p><p></p><p>3.  Except for a civilian employee transferring to a foreign PDS, the use of property management services is instead of real estate allowances for the sale of the civilian employee’s residence.</p><p></p><p>C.  Ineligible Employee.  New appointees, those assigned under the Government Civilian Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. §4109), and civilian employees transferring between foreign PDSs are ineligible for property management services.  </p><p></p><p>054603.  Property Management Services for a Civilian Employee Transferred to a Foreign PDS </p><p></p><p>A DoD Component, through the Secretarial Process, may authorize property management services on behalf of a civilian employee when a transfer to a foreign PDS is in the Government’s interest.  Property management services may be authorized only on a residence at a civilian employee’s last PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS from which the civilian employee transferred to a foreign PDS, and only after he or she signs a service agreement.</p><p></p><p>A.  Property Management Services Duration.  Property management services may be made from the time a civilian employee transfers to a foreign PDS until one of the following occurs:</p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee transfers back to a PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The civilian employee completes the tour of duty at the PDS and remains there, but does not sign a new service or renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee separates from Government service.</p><p></p><p>B.  Property Management Services Continuation.  To ensure that property management services continue after completing a tour of duty, a civilian employee must sign a new service agreement that includes property management services continuation.  The continuation of property management services is at the command’s discretion.</p><p></p><p>054604.  Property Management Services for a Civilian Employee Transferred to a PDS in the CONUS or Non-Foreign PDS OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  Property management services must be more cost-effective for the Government than the sale of the civilian employee’s residence.  The civilian employee must have signed a service agreement for a PCS within the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS.  A civilian employee who transfers back to a different PDS in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS after a foreign assignment may also be authorized property management services.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  A civilian employee is not required to repay the cost of property management services when he or she transfers to the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS after a foreign assignment and does not return to the PDS where the home is located, then chooses to sell the residence.</p><p></p><p>1.  Property management services are limited to 1 year from the civilian employee’s transfer effective date.  For transfers when both PDSs are in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS, an extension under par. 054501 may be authorized, limited to 1 additional year.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee, who is offered and accepts property management services, may later choose to sell the residence within the applicable time limit for completion of real estate transactions, with the Government reimbursing expenses per DoD Component regulations.  This authority does not extend to a civilian employee enrolled in the Home Sale Program.  Government reimbursement for expenses related to selling a residence is limited to the maximum amount for real estate transactions, less the amount paid for property management services.  If the amount paid for property management services is greater than or equals the maximum amount allowed for a real estate transaction, no reimbursement is authorized for residence sale.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>054605.  Property Management Services for a Civilian Employee Authorized a TCS</p><p></p><p>A.  TCS Property Management Services.  A civilian employee, authorized property management services for a TCS under par. 053714, is authorized property management services for the residence at the previous PDS in the CONUS or previous non-foreign PDS OCONUS from which the civilian employee commuted daily to the work location.</p><p></p><p>B.  Property Management Services End.  Authority for property management services is from the time the civilian employee transfers to the temporary official station until one of the following occurs: </p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee transfers back to the PDS or separates from Government service.</p><p></p><p>2.  The temporary official station becomes the PDS.  A civilian employee, authorized property management expenses for a real estate sale when the temporary official station becomes permanent, is required to repay any property management fees paid after the effective date of the PCS.</p><p></p><p>3.  The 30th month following transfer to the TCS duty location ends.  </p><p></p><p>054607.  Home Marketing Incentive Payments (HMIP)</p><p></p><p>The Home Marketing Incentive Payment (HMIP) significantly reduces the fees and expenses a DoD Component pays to a relocation services company and effectively lowers the relocation program cost.  The DoD Component must pay a reduced fee or reduced expenses to the relocation company due to the civilian employee’s independent marketing efforts.  A civilian employee enrolled in the Home Sale Program is limited to the payment limitations in par. 054607-C.  Subsequent reimbursement is not authorized for real estate transaction and unexpired lease expense allowances or property management services after enrolling in the Home Sale Program.  A DoD Component may offer a home marketing incentive to a civilian employee who is authorized to transfer and who meets the requirements for a residence sale with Government-reimbursed expenses.  An HMIP is at the discretion of each DoD Agency.  An HMIP may be authorized for a civilian employee of the Air Force only if he or she is traveling under civilian Career funding.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Definitions</p><p></p><p>1.  Amended Value Sale.  An “Amended Value Sale” is a home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating civilian employee receives a bona fide offer from a qualified potential buyer before the civilian employee has accepted an appraised value offer from the relocation services company.  The relocation services company amends its offer to match the net outside sale price.</p><p></p><p>2.  Appraised Value Sale.  An “Appraised Value Sale” is a type of home sale transaction that occurs when the relocating civilian employee accepts the offer from the relocation services company to buy the civilian employee’s home based upon the average of a specific number of appraisals conducted by designated certified appraisers.</p><p></p><p>3.  Buyer Value Option.  A “Buyer Value Option” is a home sale transaction with procedures the same as the amended value program except that the buy-out offer from the relocation services company is based on a bona fide offer received by the civilian employee from a qualified buyer after marketing by the civilian employee and before appraisals being ordered.  Once the offer is determined to be bona fide, the relocation services company offers to buy the home from the civilian employee at a price based on the outside sale price.</p><p></p><p>4.  Home Marketing Incentive Payment (HMIP).  A “Home Marketing Incentive Payment” is a payment made to a transferred civilian employee to encourage the civilian employee to independently and aggressively market the civilian employee’s residence and find a qualified potential buyer.</p><p></p><p>5.  Home Sale Program.  A “Home Sale Program” is a program under which a relocation services company, under contract with DoD, purchases a transferred civilian employee’s residence at the higher of either a market based or appraised value offer, then independently markets, and sells the residence.</p><p></p><p>B.  Payment Conditions.  To qualify for an HMIP, a civilian employee must:</p><p></p><p>1.  Enter the residence in the DoD Component’s home sale program.</p><p></p><p>2.  Independently and aggressively market the residence.</p><p></p><p>3.  Find a buyer for the residence through independent marketing efforts. </p><p></p><p>4.  Transfer the residence to the relocation company the buyer uses to complete the sale.</p><p></p><p>5.  Meet any additional requirements established by the DoD Component. </p><p></p><p>C.  Payment Limitations.  The DoD Component determines the HMIP amount.  If there are no savings, a home-marketing incentive may not be paid.  See the DTMO website for examples.  If it is paid, the payment is limited to the least of:</p><p></p><p>1.  $10,000.</p><p></p><p>2.  One-half of the savings from the reduced fee expenses paid due to the civilian employee finding a bona fide buyer with whom the relocation services company closes the sale.</p><p></p><p>3.  An amount within 1 to 5% of the price the relocation services company paid when it purchased the residence from the civilian employee. </p><p></p><p>D.  Authorized HMIP Offices.  Each DoD Component and Agency must determine whether an HMIP is authorized and make certain each affected civilian employee knows who to contact for information.  The offices delegated the authority to authorize an HMIP are in Table 5-96 (FTR §302-14.101(c)).</p><p></p><p>Table 5-96.  Delegated Offices for HMIP Authorization</p><p>Service</p><p>Authority</p><p>1</p><p>Army</p><p>A commander of an Army Command, commander of an Army Service Component Command, Commander or Superintendent of a Direct Reporting Unit, and the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army (AASA).  For purposes of this designation, the Principal Officials of Headquarters, Department of the Army, their staff and other elements, including Field Operating Agencies, Staff Support Agencies, and those Direct Reporting Units not listed, including the U.S. Army Acquisition Support Center, fall under the purview of the AASA.  This authority may be re-delegated at the commander or Agency head’s discretion, but no lower than the local commander or activity head.</p><p>2</p><p>Navy</p><p>Major Claimants.</p><p>3</p><p>Air Force*</p><p>AFPC/DPIFSA</p><p>555 E.

Whether in the CONUS or OCONUS, an authorized POV must be in operating order and legally titled and tagged for driving.  POVs may not be shipped as part of professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP&amp;E). </p><p></p><p>054701.  POV Transportation in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>POV transportation from the old PDS to the new PDS may be authorized or approved if the civilian employee is transferred in the Government’s interest, or from the actual residence to the new PDS of a new appointee or student trainee relocating to the first PDS in CONUS, when the transportation is advantageous to the Government.  A civilian employee may be reimbursed the cost of towing equipment or a car carrier used for transporting the POV to the new PDS if POV transportation at Government expense is authorized or approved.  Mileage reimbursement is not allowed for the towed vehicle. </p><p></p><p>054702.  Authorizing POV Transportation in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>Commanding officers, or their designated representatives, are authorized to determine eligibility to transport a POV at Government expense.  Both the old PDS, or the actual residence of a new appointee or student trainee, and the new PDS must be within the CONUS.  The distance the POV is shipped must be 600 or more miles.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  It must be more advantageous and cost effective to the Government to transport the POV to the new PDS at Government expense and to pay for transportation of the civilian employee or immediate family by other means than to have the civilian employee or immediate family member drive a POV, or two POVs if applicable, to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>1.  Each DoD Component determines that the POV is in operating order, legally titled, and tagged for driving before POV transportation within the CONUS, and that the traveler cited on the relocation travel order is licensed to drive the POV.</p><p></p><p>2.  The Service or Agency determines the number of POVs authorized transportation at Government expense, limited to two.  Two POVs can be authorized only when at least two licensed drivers are on the relocation travel order.</p><p></p><p>B.  Mandatory Cost Comparison.  For each travel order, an AO must consider the cost of POV travel, the cost of transporting the POV, travel costs if the POV is transported, and the productivity benefit from the civilian employee’s accelerated arrival at the new PDS.  Performing a cost comparison is mandatory for each order.  </p><p></p><p>054703.  Shipment Methods in the CONUS</p><p></p><p>A.  Government or Civilian Employee Arranges POV Transportation.  When the Government arranges POV transportation, the Transportation Officer determines the transportation mode.  Shipment procedures must follow the regulations in DTR 4500.9-R.  When POV shipment is authorized at Government expense and the civilian employee personally arranges the POV transportation, reimbursement is limited to the civilian employee’s actual expenses, limited to the POV transportation cost from the authorized origin to the authorized destination. </p><p></p><p>B.  Specially Equipped Automobile.  The DoD Component may arrange transportation for a specially equipped automobile between PDSs in the CONUS on behalf of a traveler with a disability.  The transportation must be for a PCS.  If the civilian employee personally procures transportation, then the reimbursement for the POV is for the actual expenses, limited to what it would have cost the Government to transport the POV.  The primary consideration for transporting a specially equipped automobile must be that it is cost beneficial as determined through the Secretarial Process.  Reimbursement must constitute a reasonable accommodation to the traveler and must not impose undue hardship on the DoD Component’s personnel relocation program. </p><p></p><p>054704.  POV Transportation OCONUS</p><p></p><p> Transportation allowances for shipping a POV are authorized unless restricted by the AO, Service or Agency regulations, or the local government OCONUS.  POV transportation allowance are discretionary.  Only one POV may be transported at Government expense to, from, or between locations OCONUS.  A POV is limited to a gross shipping size of 20 measurement tons (800 cubic feet) or less.  A civilian employee who ships a larger POV that otherwise qualifies for shipment at Government expense is financially responsible for all costs resulting from the excess POV size.  POV transportation is not authorized if the civilian employee or a dependent can use hard-surfaced, all-weather highways and ferries to drive the POV to the PDS, unless the Service or Agency determines it is to the Government’s advantage.  See Chapters 2 and 3 for transportation by car ferry and to section 0539 for per diem while on a car ferry. </p><p></p><p>054705.  Eligibility Determination for POV Transportation OCONUS</p><p></p><p>Commanding officers, or their designated representatives, who assign civilian employees OCONUS determine civilian employee eligibility for POV transportation at Government expense.  Authorizations must comply with the criteria in this section and ensure consistent treatment of all DoD civilian employees.  Commanding officers, or their designated representatives, in the CONUS who assign civilian employees OCONUS must comply with the eligibility criteria established for the specific area OCONUS and obtain clearance from the appropriate command OCONUS.  When the civilian employee agrees to serve a succeeding tour of duty at the same or another PDS OCONUS, the commanding officer must determine that it is still in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to retain the POV at the PDS.  A written record of any determination must be filed according to personnel directives. </p><p></p><p>A.  Determination of Government Interest.  All of the following conditions must be met to determine that it is in the Government’s interest for a civilian employee to have a POV at the PDS OCONUS:</p><p></p><p>1.  The POV is not primarily for the civilian employee’s and immediate family’s convenience.</p><p></p><p>2.  Local conditions make it desirable for the civilian employee to have a POV.</p><p></p><p>3.  POV use by the civilian employee contributes to the effectiveness of the civilian employee’s job.</p><p></p><p>4.  The POV type is suitable for local conditions.</p><p></p><p>5.  The transportation cost to or from the PDS is not excessive considering the time the civilian employee has agreed to serve at that PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Specific to Civilian Employee Assigned to Johnston Island</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee may transport one POV at Government expense from the port or vehicle processing center (VPC) serving the old PDS to the port or VPC serving Hawaii, if the dependents reside in Hawaii during the tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>2.  When reassigned from Johnston Island to a new PDS, the civilian employee may transport one POV from the port or VPC serving Hawaii to the port or VPC serving the new PDS or an alternate port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee may be authorized POV transportation when he or she is assigned to Johnston Island, had a POV transported to Hawaii, and is returning to the CONUS due to transfer or upon completion of a tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>4.  The civilian employee may be authorized POV transportation when he or she did not complete a tour of duty on Johnston Island, had a POV transported to Hawaii, and is returning due to transfer for the Government’s convenience and not at personal request.  </p><p></p><p>5.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for all excess costs of transporting the POV from the port or VPC serving Hawaii to the port or VPC from which the POV was originally transported to Hawaii.</p><p></p><p>6.  When a civilian employee is assigned on Johnston Island, POV transportation may be authorized to the CONUS at the civilian employee’s request if the POV was transported to Hawaii and he or she transfers to another PDS OCONUS where it is not in the Government’s interest to have a POV.</p><p></p><p>C.  General Rules for POV Transportation Involving a Location OCONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  When a civilian employee is at a PDS OCONUS and he or she is transferred to another PDS OCONUS where it is not in the Government’s interest to have a POV, POV transportation may be authorized to the CONUS at the civilian employee’s request if it was initially in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV. </p><p></p><p>2.  When a civilian employee is at a PDS OCONUS where it was initially in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV and circumstances change so that it is no longer in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV, POV transportation may be authorized.  The civilian employee may choose to keep the POV at the PDS or to have it shipped back at Government expense to the port or VPC serving the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>3.  A POV may be authorized in any of the following situations when a civilian employee:</p><p></p><p>a.  Transfers or is assigned from a PDS in the CONUS to a PDS OCONUS, meets the eligibility criteria in par. 054705, and signs a service agreement. </p><p></p><p>b.  Transfers or is assigned from a PDS OCONUS to another PDS OCONUS, meets the eligibility criteria in par. 054705, and signs a service agreement. </p><p></p><p>c.  Is at a PDS OCONUS where it was initially not in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV and circumstances change so that it is later in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV, meets the eligibility criteria in par. 054705, and signs a service agreement. </p><p>d.  Completes a tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS where it was in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV and is returning to the CONUS due to a transfer or upon completion of duty.</p><p></p><p>e.  Does not complete a tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS where it was in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV and is returning due to a transfer for the Government’s convenience and not at personal request.</p><p></p><p>D.  POV Transportation not Authorized</p><p></p><p>Table 5-97.  POV Transportation not Authorized</p><p>If a civilian employee…</p><p>Then POV transportation …</p><p>1</p><p>is recruited at a location OCONUS for a first PDS duty in the CONUS,</p><p>is not authorized.</p><p>2</p><p>ships a POV from a PDS OCONUS due to the return of a dependent to the United States before he or she is eligible for POV transportation,</p><p>is not authorized, unless determined that it is in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>054706.  Care and Storage for POV Transportation OCONUS</p><p></p><p>The Government’s responsibility for care and storage of the POV begins when it is accepted for transportation and continues until the POV is delivered to the civilian employee at the destination or a commercial warehouse.  If the civilian employee does not claim the POV within a reasonable time after notification of arrival is given, as determined by the port commander, it may be placed in commercial storage at the civilian employee’s expense.</p><p></p><p>054707.  Shipment Methods OCONUS</p><p></p><p>If the Government arranges transportation, the Transportation Officer determines the transportation mode following the POV transportation regulations in DTR 4500.9-R.  If a civilian employee is authorized POV transportation at Government expense and then personally arranges the transportation, reimbursement is for the civilian employee’s actual expenses, limited to the POV transportation cost from the port or VPC serving the authorized origin point to the port or VPC serving the authorized destination.  A civilian employee who contracts directly with a shipping company for POV shipment is entirely responsible for all issues related to the Status of Forces Agreement, the use of U.S. carriers, import and export processes, and any tariffs, customs, or other related issues.  If Service regulations require, preference also must be given to Voluntary Inter-modal Sealift Agreement ship carriers when available.</p><p></p><p>054708.  Ports and Vehicle Processing Centers (VPCs) for POV Transportation OCONUS</p><p></p><p>A.  Ports Used.  POV transportation at Government expense is authorized between the port or VPC serving the origin point and the port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s new PDS.  For a civilian employee assigned to Johnston Island, transportation at Government expense is to the point or VPC serving Hawaii if a dependent resides in Hawaii during the tour.  The Service concerned designates ports and VPCs used for loading and unloading POVs transported under this section.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A POV may be transported to an alternate designated port or VPC, but the Government’s liability for transportation costs is limited to the cost between the ports or VPCs serving the old PDS and new PDS.  For a civilian employee assigned to Johnston Island, the Government’s liability for transportation costs is limited to the cost to transport the POV from the authorized port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a civilian employee is authorized to return a POV at Government expense from the location OCONUS to which it was transported, the POV may be transported from the port or VPC serving that PDS.  For a civilian employee assigned to Johnston Island, he or she is authorized to return a POV from the authorized port or VPC in Hawaii to the port serving the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee may drive or transport the POV to a different port or VPC serving the destination specified by the civilian employee.  The Government’s liability for transportation costs must not be higher than the transportation costs from the port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s old PDS to the port or VPC serving the authorized destination, which is either the new PDS or actual residence.</p><p></p><p>B.  POV Transportation to and from Ports</p><p></p><p>1.  POV transportation at Government expense is limited to over-water movement from an appropriate loading port or VPC in the CONUS to an appropriate unloading port or VPC serving the PDS OCONUS and return.</p><p></p><p>2.  POV movement can be between appropriate ports or VPCs serving PDSs OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  POV movement can be from the appropriate loading port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s last PDS to the unloading port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s new PDS.</p><p></p><p>4.  Transportation at Government expense includes port handling charges for readying the POV for shipment at the loading port or VPC and use at the unloading port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>5.  If no port or VPC is at the point of origin or destination, the DoD Component must pay the entire cost of transporting the POV:</p><p></p><p>a.  From the old PDS or the actual residence at the time of employment.</p><p></p><p>b.  To the port or VPC serving the old PDS or actual residence.</p><p></p><p>c.  From the port or VPC to the new PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Upon return due to a PCS or for separation, to the actual residence at the time of appointment or assignment to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p>6.  Shipment may not be authorized at Government expense for the civilian employee’s convenience.  If assigned to Johnston Island, see par. 054705-B.  </p><p></p><p>054709.  Reimbursement for POV Delivery and Pick-up</p><p></p><p>A.  Civilian Employee Pays for POV Transportation.  A civilian employee may be reimbursed if he or she pays another individual to drive the POV or arranges to have the POV transported commercially to or from the port or VPC.  Reimbursement is limited to the actual cost of having the POV transported between any of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee’s old PDS, or actual residence at the time of appointment, and the authorized port or VPC.</p><p></p><p>2.  The authorized port or VPC and the civilian employee’s new PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  The authorized port or VPC and the civilian employee’s actual residence at the time of appointment or assignment to a PDS OCONUS, whichever is applicable, when returning by PCS or for separation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employee Makes a Separate Trip to Deliver or Pick-up a POV at the Port or VPC.  City Pair Program airfares may not be used for transportation to or from the port or VPC for POV pick-up or delivery.</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee, or designated representative, is not authorized per diem.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a civilian employee drives a POV to or from the port or VPC, the following allowances apply:  </p><p></p><p>a.  PCS MALT for the official distance from the old PDS to the port or VPC and one-way transportation costs from the port or VPC to the old PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  One-way transportation from the new PDS to the port or VPC to pick up the POV and PCS MALT for the official distance between the port or VPC and the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>C.  POV Delivery and Pick-up as Part of PDT by POV (Other than During RAT).  If a civilian employee uses a POV for PDT, he or she may be authorized reimbursement for POV delivery and pick-up during that PDT.  This includes first duty-station travel, PCS travel, or separation travel.  This does not include RAT.</p><p></p><p>1.  Driving Reimbursement.  Reimbursement is authorized at the applicable PCS MALT rate from:</p><p></p><p>a.  The civilian employee’s old PDS, or actual residence at the time of appointment, to the port or VPC. </p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee’s old PDS, or actual residence at the time of appointment, to the port of embarkation if the civilian employee travels there to drop off a dependent.</p><p></p><p>c.  The port of embarkation where the civilian employee drops off a dependent to the port or VPC to drop off the POV.</p><p>d.  The port or VPC where the civilian employee reclaims the POV to the port of debarkation if the civilian employee returns there to pick up a dependent.</p><p></p><p>e.  The port or VPC to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>f.  The port of debarkation, if the civilian employee returns there to pick up a dependent, and to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>g.  The port or VPC to the actual residence at the time of appointment or assignment to a PDS OCONUS upon return for separation.</p><p></p><p>h.  The port of debarkation, if the civilian employee returns there to pick up a dependent, to the actual residence at the time of appointment or assignment to a PDS OCONUS upon return for separation.</p><p></p><p>2.  Transportation Reimbursement.  In addition to reimbursement at the applicable PCS MALT rate, a civilian employee may be authorized payment of one of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  The transportation cost for the civilian employee, or for the civilian employee and a dependent, from the port or VPC where the civilian employee delivers the POV to the passenger port of embarkation.</p><p></p><p>b.  PCS MALT from where the civilian employee drops off a dependent at the port of embarkation to the port or VPC where the civilian employee delivers the POV and the civilian employee’s return transportation to the port of embarkation.</p><p></p><p>c.  The transportation cost for the civilian employee, or for a civilian employee and a dependent, from the port of debarkation to the vehicle unloading port or VPC to reclaim the POV.</p><p></p><p>d.  The civilian employee’s transportation cost from the port of debarkation to the vehicle unloading port or VPC where the civilian employee reclaims the POV.</p><p>054710.  POV Purchased in a Non-Foreign Area OCONUS</p><p></p><p>If a civilian employee purchases a POV in a non-foreign area OCONUS where he or she is not permanently assigned at the time of purchase, POV transportation is not authorized unless the POV is a replacement vehicle at the non-foreign PDS OCONUS.  The transportation at Government expense of the purchased POV is not authorized for the civilian employee’s next PCS.</p><p></p><p>054711.  Delay of POV Arrival and Reimbursement for Rental Vehicle </p><p>There is no authority for rental car reimbursement while awaiting POV arrival.  The civilian employee should check to see if the POV shipping contract contains rental provisions.</p><p></p><p>054712.  Replacement POV Shipment</p><p></p><p>When a POV transported at Government expense to an area OCONUS, including to Hawaii for a civilian employee assigned to Johnston Island, is no longer adequate for the civilian employee’s transportation needs, replacement POV transportation may be authorized through the Secretarial Process under the following conditions:</p><p>A.  U.S. Government Safety and Emission Regulations.  The replacement POV available at the PDS OCONUS must meet U.S. Government motor vehicle safety and emission regulations for transportation to a location in the CONUS or a non-foreign location.  A non-conforming POV is not an adequate replacement vehicle since the civilian employee would incur charges to transport the vehicle back to the CONUS.  The civilian employee is responsible for any additional costs, including required bonded transport, if he or she chooses to import a non-conforming POV.  See DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, App K3 (Shipping Your POV) for non-conforming POV transportation requirements.</p><p></p><p>B.  Emergency Replacement.  The DoD Component must decide whether the reasons for the need of a replacement POV are acceptable.  The reasons must be beyond the civilian employee’s control, such as when the POV is stolen, seriously damaged, destroyed, or has deteriorated due to severe climate conditions, and an adequate replacement vehicle must not be available at the PDS OCONUS to authorize an emergency replacement.  One emergency replacement POV may be transported at Government expense within any 4-year continuous service period. </p><p></p><p>C.  Non-Emergency Replacement.  A civilian employee must be located at one or more PDSs OCONUS during a continuous 4-year period, the POV being replaced must have worn out due to age and normal deterioration, and an adequate replacement vehicle is not available at the PDS OCONUS.  It must be in the Government’s interest that the civilian employee continues to have a POV at the PDS OCONUS.  The Government will pay transportation costs for a non-emergency replacement of a POV no more than once every 4 years</p><p></p><p>054713.  POV Transportation for Transfer or Assignment between PDSs OCONUS</p><p></p><p>If a civilian employee transfers or receives an assignment from one PDS OCONUS to another PDS OCONUS and the civilian employee does not have a POV at the current PDS OCONUS, one POV may be transported at Government expense to the port or VPC serving the new PDS.  The amount the Government pays is limited to the POV transportation cost from a designated port or VPC within the CONUS or a port or VPC in Hawaii for a civilian employee assigned on Johnston Island with a dependent who resides in Hawaii.  If, due to changed circumstances at a PDS, it is no longer in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV at the PDS, the civilian employee may transport it at Government expense to the civilian employee’s new PDS OCONUS, if it is in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have the POV there.  Upon completion of a tour of duty at the new PDS, a civilian employee may ship the POV at Government expense to the port or VPC serving the actual residence or serving a PDS in the CONUS.  In this case, the cost is limited to the transportation cost from the place to which it was last transported at Government expense.</p><p></p><p>054714.  POV Transportation if Agreement not Completed and Civilian Employee Transfers or Is Reassigned from OCONUS to the CONUS </p><p>If a civilian employee, for reasons unacceptable to the DoD Component concerned, fails to complete the tour of duty at the current PDS, and the transfer is not for the Government’s convenience, the Government may not pay for POV transportation.  The Government pays POV transportation if the civilian employee completed a tour of duty at a previous PDS OCONUS where it was in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV.  In that case, the Government pays for POV transportation, but costs are limited to the POV transportation from the port or VPC serving the PDS where the civilian employee completed the tour of duty.</p><p></p><p></p><p>054715.  POV Transportation if Agreement not Completed and Civilian Employee Returns to the CONUS for Separation</p><p></p><p>If a civilian employee, for reasons unacceptable to the DoD Component concerned, fails to complete the tour of duty at the PDS from which the civilian employee is separating, and the transfer is not for the Government’s convenience, the Government may not pay for POV transportation.  The Government pays POV transportation if the civilian employee completed a tour of duty at a previous PDS OCONUS where it was in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV.  In that case, the Government pays for POV transportation, but costs are limited to the POV transportation from the port or VPC serving the PDS where the civilian employee completed the tour of duty.  If the POV is transported to a location other than the port or VPC serving the actual residence, the Government’s liability is limited to the POV transportation cost to the appropriate port or VPC serving the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>054716.  POV Transportation if a Civilian Employee Separated Following Completion of the Agreed Minimum Period of Service or for Reasons Acceptable to the Government </p><p></p><p>POV transportation may be authorized for a civilian employee separating because the agreed minimum period of service is completed or for reasons acceptable to the Government.  Transportation may be authorized from the port or VPC serving the PDS OCONUS to which it was transported at Government expense to the port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s actual residence established at the time of appointment or transfer to the PDS.  POV transportation may be authorized to an alternate destination anywhere in the world, but the Government’s POV transportation cost is limited to the cost from the port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s PDS OCONUS to the port or VPC serving the civilian employee’s actual residence.  Any excess costs are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.</p><p>054717.  Delays While Awaiting Port or VPC Reopening or POV Delivery </p><p>When PCS travel by POV is to the Government’s advantage, per diem may be authorized for delays in picking up the POV that are beyond a civilian employee’s control.  If a civilian employee must pick up a POV at a port or VPC to continue PCS travel, the civilian employee is unable to reclaim the POV on the arrival day, and the days following the arrival day are non-workdays when the port or VPC is closed, per diem is authorized during that time.  Per diem is also authorized for the days the civilian employee’s POV has not been delivered to the port or VPC on the day the civilian employee arrives to reclaim it and the civilian employee awaits POV delivery to continue PCS travel.  The designated port authority must certify that the civilian employee acted reasonably and prudently by remaining at the port or VPC to await the POV’s arrival. </p><p></p><p>0548  OTHER CATEGORIES AND SITUATIONS</p><p></p><p>054801.  First Duty-Station Travel</p><p></p><p>Travel and transportation allowances may be authorized for appointees or student trainees assigned to a first PDS.  When an AO authorizes reimbursement for travel and transportation allowances, all mandatory allowances must be reimbursed.  The restrictions in par. 054802 for short-distance transfers do not apply to first duty-station travel.  When first duty-station travel is involved, the hiring DoD Component may or may not, at its discretion, authorize or approve payment of applicable first duty-station travel and transportation allowances in par. 054801-D.  Each DoD Component must ensure that a new appointee is counseled as specified in par. 053709 and be informed of benefits’ availability and limitations.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  First duty-station travel and transportation expenses may only be allowed for the following persons:</p><p></p><p>1.  A new appointee to any position.  For new appointees, as defined in par. 054801-B, the provisions of this Part apply to relocation to the first PDS from the actual residence at the time of appointment.</p><p></p><p>2.  A student trainee assigned to any position upon completion of college work.</p><p></p><p>3.  Presidential Transition Team personnel newly appointed to Government service who have performed transition activities under section 3 of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. §102, Note) and are appointed to Government service in the same fiscal year as the Presidential inauguration that immediately follows their transition activities.  For Presidential Transition Team personnel, it is from the actual residence at the time following the most recent Presidential election, but before selection or appointment. </p><p></p><p>B.  New Appointee.  A civilian employee separated due to a RIF or transfer of function and who is re-employed within 1 year after such action is not a new appointee and is treated as a transferee under par. 053713 and par. 054805.  A new appointee includes any of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  An individual who is employed with the Federal Government for the first time.</p><p></p><p>2.  Presidential Transition Team personnel (see par. 054801-A3). </p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee returning to the Government after a break in service. </p><p></p><p>4.  A student trainee assigned to the Government upon completion of college.</p><p></p><p>C.  Service Agreement and Other Requirements.  To receive reimbursement of allowable travel and transportation expenses, an appointee or student trainee assigned to a first PDS must sign a service agreement to remain in Government service for a 12-month minimum, beginning the date he or she reports for duty at the first or new PDS.  This is required unless the civilian employee is separated for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the DoD Component concerned.  If the civilian employee violates the written service agreement, including through failure to report for duty at the first or new PDS, he or she bears financial responsibility to repay any Government funds spent for travel, transportation, moving and HHG storage, and all other allowances authorized.  Authorized expenses may be paid even if the civilian employee concerned has not been appointed at the time he or she travels to the first PDS, provided he or she has signed a service agreement.  Travel and transportation for Presidential Transition Team personnel may take place any time following the most recent Presidential election, but expense reimbursement cannot occur until the individual’s actual appointment.  A student trainee may not receive payments at the time of assignment if travel and transportation expenses were paid when the trainee was appointed as a student trainee.</p><p></p><p>D.  Expenses Allowed and not Allowed.  The following expenses are payable when the hiring DoD Component authorizes or approves travel to the first PDS at Government expense.  Not all of the listed items are applicable in every situation.  An advance for allowable expenses may be made to appointees or student trainees.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-98.  Allowances for Travel to the First Duty Station</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.  Travel and transportation, including per diem, for the appointee or student trainee.</p><p>b.  Transportation for the appointee’s or student trainee’s dependent.</p><p>c.  MALT if a POV is used.</p><p>d.  HHG transportation and SIT.</p><p>e.  NTS (extended storage) of HHG if appointed to an isolated location or assigned to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p>f.  Mobile home transportation.</p><p>g.  POV shipment when authorized by the DoD Component.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Authorized</p><p>a.  AEA is not authorized or approved for first duty-station travel.</p><p>b.  Lease breaking expense.  See the DSSR when PCS involves a PDS OCONUS.</p><p>c.  A HHT.</p><p>d.  TQSE.</p><p>e.  MEA.  See DSSR §241.2, if the first duty station is to a duty location in a foreign area OCONUS.</p><p>f.  Residence sale and purchase expense.</p><p>g.  Per diem for dependents.</p><p>h.  Relocation service.</p><p></p><p>E.  Reimbursement Limitations.  Reimbursement is limited to the cost of allowable travel and transportation directly between the individual’s actual residence at the time of selection or assignment and the PDS to which appointed or assigned.  Travel may be from or to other locations, but the new appointee or student trainee is financially responsible for any excess cost involved.</p><p></p><p>F.  New Civilian Employee Assigned to a PDS OCONUS.  Travel and transportation allowances are from the actual residence, at the time of appointment, to the PDS OCONUS.  For Presidential Transition Team appointees, this is limited to expenses incurred from the actual residence from which the civilian employee relocated to perform Presidential transition activities to the assigned PDS.</p><p></p><p>054802.  Short-Distance Transfers </p><p></p><p>PCS claims for allowances authorized in an order must satisfy the requirements in this paragraph before reimbursement is allowed.  Restrictions in this paragraph do not apply to first duty-station travel.</p><p></p><p>A.  50-Mile Distance Test.  When a PCS is in the Government’s interest, an AO may authorize or approve PCS travel and transportation allowances to a new PDS that meets the 50-mile distance test and results in a residence relocation.  Ordinarily, a residence relocation is not for a PCS unless the civilian employee’s proposed new residence is closer to the new PDS than the residence from which he or she commuted daily to the old PDS.  If the civilian employee changes the proposed new residence location, the AO must review the change for compliance with these criteria.  Non-compliance of the new residence location is grounds for denial of the various allowances.</p><p></p><p>1.  The 50-mile distance test is met when the distance to new PDS from the civilian employee’s current residence is at least 50 miles further than the distance between the old PDS and that same residence.  The distance is the shortest of the commonly traveled routes between the PDS and the residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  The AO must consider commuting time and distance between the residence at the time of PCS notification and the old PDS and new PDS and the time and distance between the proposed new residence and the new PDS to determine that the residence relocation is for a PCS.</p><p>B.  Exception to Distance Requirement.  On a case-by-case basis, the AO may authorize PCS expense reimbursement for PCS moves of less than 50 miles when the move is in the Government’s interest.  In addition, an exception may be authorized (for example, BRAC) through the Secretarial Process.  </p><p></p><p>054803.  Reassignment Travel from Duty OCONUS to a New or Different PDS in the CONUS not Located at the Actual Residence</p><p></p><p>If the gaining activity authorizes PCS allowances, and the civilian employee signs a service agreement, the new PDS pays the additional PCS allowances in par. 054804-A for travel from the PDS OCONUS to the new PDS, plus dependent per diem, MEA, real estate allowances, if applicable, and HHT and TQSE, if authorized.  It also pays for NTS of HHG if the civilian employee is assigned to an isolated location in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>054804.  Reassignment Travel from Duty OCONUS to the Actual Residence</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee is authorized travel and transportation allowances to the actual residence upon reassignment.  He or she must have a service agreement that provides for those allowances and have served the required tour of duty in the current service agreement.  The service period requirement may be waived if the separation is for reasons that are beyond the civilian employee’s control and that are acceptable to his or her activity.  The civilian employee is authorized travel and transportation allowances from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence established at the time of appointment or transfer to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>A.  Losing Activity OCONUS Responsibility.  Travel and transportation allowances paid by the losing activity OCONUS include the civilian employee’s and dependent’s transportation, the civilian employee’s per diem, HHG transportation and SIT, and POV transportation, if authorized in the Government’s interest for the civilian employee to have a POV at the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Gaining  Activity in the CONUS Responsibility.  Travel and transportation allowances paid by the gaining PDS in the CONUS include dependent per diem, MEA, and TQSE, if authorized.  It also pays for NTS of HHG if the civilian employee is assigned to an isolated location in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>054805.  Movement of a Civilian Employee or Re-employed Former Civilian Employee Affected by a Reduction in Force (RIF) or Transfer of Function (FTR §302-3)</p><p></p><p>An involuntary transfer due to a RIF or transfer of function is in the Government’s interest and PCS allowances are authorized.  When a civilian employee is assigned to any new duty location due to a RIF or transfer of function before separation, travel and transportation allowances are from the old PDS to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>A.  Reemployment after RIF or Transfer of Function.  If the Federal Government rehires a former civilian employee after separation due to a RIF or transfer of function, the travel and transportation allowances are from the PDS at separation to the new PDS, provided it is within 1 year of the separation date under a non-temporary appointment and the new PDS is different from the old PDS.  The new PDS must meet the distance requirements for a short-distance transfer.  The civilian employee must agree in writing to remain in Government service for 12 months beginning the date the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS.  If the civilian employee violates the written agreement, including failure to report for duty at the new PDS, any Government funds spent for authorized allowances are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility. </p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employee Transferring to the U.S. Postal Service.  PCS allowances may also be authorized for a DoD civilian employee (5 U.S.C. §5735) who is scheduled for separation from DoD, other than for cause, and who is selected for and accepts an appointment to a continuing position with the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p></p><p>054806.  Return from Military Duty </p><p></p><p>A civilian employee returning from military duty authorized mandatory restoration under 5 CFR §353, who finds that an appropriate vacancy does not exist at the PDS where the civilian employee resigned to enter the U.S. Armed Forces is restored to the same PDS.  Travel and transportation allowance payment is in the Government’s interest from the restoration place to a place where a suitable DoD vacancy is available.</p><p></p><p>A.  Real Estate Allowances.  Reimbursement is allowed for authorized real estate expenses incurred by the civilian employee for the sale or unexpired lease settlement of a residence at the former civilian PDS and the purchase of a residence at the new PDS.  The criteria concerning short-distance transfers apply.  Reimbursement is prohibited for any sale, unexpired lease settlement, or purchase transaction that occurs before the civilian employee officially receives notice that he or she would be assigned to a different PDS than the one where the civilian employee resigned to enter the Armed Forces.  Real estate expenses are authorized for the sale of the home occupied as a residence while serving on active military duty instead of a home at the former civilian PDS.  PCS allowances are authorized from the location of the civilian employee’s home used as a residence while serving on active military duty to the civilian employee’s new PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Travel and Transportation Allowances.  A civilian employee returning from the location where he or she was released from duty in the U.S. Armed Forces directly to a new civilian PDS, other than the one from which the civilian employee resigned or entered leave without pay to enter the U.S. Armed Forces, has separate and distinct travel and transportation allowances.  In that case, a civilian employee is authorized MEA, reimbursement of expenses for sale or purchase of a residence or an unexpired lease, and when specifically included in the PCS order, an HHT, and TQSE.  Travel and transportation allowances are based on the civilian employee’s status.</p><p></p><p>1.  A Service member being discharged is authorized travel and transportation allowances under Chapter 5, Part B from the place released from the U.S. Armed Forces to the home of record or the place last entered active duty.  If the entire cost for moving the civilian employee, any dependents, and HHG from the place of release from the U.S. Armed Forces to the new civilian PDS is provided under the civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances as a Service member being discharged, no additional payment is allowed.  If the entire cost for travel and transportation is not covered under the discharge order, then the travel and transportation allowances are paid for uncovered allowable expenses under the civilian PCS order.</p><p></p><p>2.  A civilian employee is allowed all of the travel and transportation allowances authorized when returning from military duty in addition to the travel and transportation allowances available for him or herself, eligible dependents, and HHG from the civilian PDS where the civilian employee resigned to enter the U.S. Armed Forces to the new civilian PDS.</p><p></p><p></p><p>054807.  Waiver of Limitations for a Civilian Employee Relocating to or from a Remote or Isolated Location (FTR §302-2) </p><p></p><p>PCS allowance limitations authorized in 5 U.S.C. §5721-§5739, and in these regulations may be waived through the Secretarial Process for any civilian employee relocating to or from a remote or isolated location who would suffer a hardship if the limitation was not waived.  The official waiving PCS limitations must certify, in writing, both the waiver and the reason for the waiver.  The DTMO website lists locations designated as remote or isolated, with the effective date and recertification dates, which occur every other year.  </p><p></p><p>A.  Requesting Designation of PDS as a Remote or Isolated Location.  A request to designate a PDS as a remote or isolated location should be submitted, with justification, to the PDTATAC through the appropriate Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or OSD member on the Civilian Advisory Panel.  Justification for continuing a PDS designation as an isolated or remote location must reach the PDTATAC.</p><p></p><p>B.  Qualifications for Waiver.  In the circumstances below, any PDS is a remote or isolated location for the waiver allowed by this paragraph, if listed on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p>1.  Daily Commuting Impractical.  The DoD Component management requires the civilian employee to remain at the PDS during the workweek as a normal and continuing part of the employment conditions and the PDS location and available transportation make daily commuting impractical.</p><p></p><p>2.  Extraordinary Conditions.  Due to extraordinary circumstances, the only means to travel to the PDS are by boat, aircraft, or unusual mode of transportation.  The distance, time, and commuting conditions result in expense, inconvenience, or hardship significantly greater than that encountered in metropolitan-area commuting.</p><p></p><p>054808.  Missing Persons </p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who is officially reported as dead, interned in a foreign country, captured by a hostile force, injured with recovery expected to require a long duration, or missing for a period of 30 or more days is considered a “missing person” in this paragraph.  The DoD Component commander is responsible for administrative determinations, obtaining required authorizations or approvals, and issuing travel orders.</p><p></p><p>A.  Definition.  For this paragraph, a “dependent” includes:</p><p></p><p>1.  A lawful spouse.</p><p></p><p>2.  An unmarried child less than 21 years old, including a dependent stepchild or adopted child.</p><p></p><p>3.  A dependent designated as such in official records.</p><p></p><p>4.  An individual determined to be a dependent by the DoD Component head or designated representative.</p><p></p><p>B.  Eligibility.  Transportation at Government expense is authorized for eligible dependents, HHG, and the personal items of a civilian employee considered a missing person who meets the requirements in par. 054812-A and all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>1.  He or she is a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or an alien who has been admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  He or she is not employed part time or intermittently and must not work as locally hired labor on an hourly or per diem basis.</p><p></p><p>3.  He or she has a residence at or near the place of U.S. employment or in a foreign country and is not living there solely due to the employment (5 U.S.C. §5564).  </p><p></p><p>C.  Allowable Expenses.  Travel and transportation is allowed to the civilian employee’s actual residence or other place authorized or approved by the DoD Component.  Transportation of HHG and personal items is limited to allowable weight limits.  One POV may be transported if the vehicle is located OCONUS.  When the civilian employee is in an “injured” status, transportation of dependents, HHG, and personal items may be authorized only if the hospitalization or treatment period is expected to be a long duration.</p><p></p><p>054809.  Separation Travel from Duty OCONUS (FTR §302-3, Subpart D)</p><p></p><p>See par. 054810 for a separating SES civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee is authorized travel and transportation allowances to the actual residence upon separation from Government service if the civilian employee has resigned or been separated involuntarily.  The civilian employee must have a service agreement that provides for those allowances and have served the period required in the current service agreement.  The service period requirement may be waived if the separation is for reasons that are beyond the civilian employee’s control and that are acceptable to his or her activity.  The resignation must be executed before the civilian employee leaves the activity OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the civilian employee chooses to separate OCONUS for personal reasons, the decision must be in writing and include a statement that the civilian employee understands the loss of travel and transportation allowances.  </p><p></p><p>3.  A locally hired civilian employee OCONUS who is not eligible to sign an agreement is not authorized separation travel and transportation allowances.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Separation Travel and Transportation Allowances.  The civilian employee separating from duty OCONUS is authorized travel and transportation allowances for travel from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence established at the time of appointment or transfer to that PDS.  He or she may be authorized travel and transportation allowances for travel to an alternate destination limited to the constructed cost for travel from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence.  If the civilian employee is separated from a PDS in the same locality as the actual residence or alternate location, he or she is not authorized travel and transportation allowances.  If a civilian employee does not use or loses personal travel and transportation allowances, he or she is authorized travel and transportation allowances for eligible dependents and HHG, provided the travel and transportation allowances are used within a reasonable time.  The circumstances of anticipated partial or delayed travel and transportation allowances use should be in writing.  Table 5-99 specifies which allowances are authorized during separation.</p><p>Table 5-99.  Authorized Allowances when Separating</p><p>1</p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.  Civilian employee’s transportation and per diem.</p><p>b.  Dependent transportation.</p><p>c.  HHG transportation.</p><p>d.  POV shipment, including delivery and pick-up of a POV, if a POV was determined to be in the Government’s interest at the PDS OCONUS.</p><p>2</p><p>Not </p><p>Authorized</p><p>a.  Any excess costs.</p><p>b.  Per diem for dependents.</p><p>c.  TQSE.</p><p>d.  MEA.</p><p>e.  Residence sale or purchase expenses.</p><p>f.  Lease-breaking expenses.</p><p>g.  NTS of HHG.</p><p>h.  RIT allowance.</p><p>i.  Relocation services.</p><p></p><p>C.  Reasonable Time Limitations.  A civilian employee separating from duty OCONUS who refuses to accept or use return travel and transportation allowances after release from work status in a position OCONUS loses those allowances.  The commanding officer for the activity OCONUS may authorize a delay for a reasonable period upon receipt of a civilian employee’s written request.  Ordinarily, a delay of 90 or fewer calendar days is reasonable.  Under unusual extenuating circumstances that, in the commanding officer’s opinion, warrant a longer delay, return travel may be delayed up to 1 year from the separation date.</p><p></p><p>1.  If the commanding officer at the activity OCONUS does not receive a request for delay, or if the civilian employee refuses to accept or use travel and transportation allowances by the expiration of the authorized or approved delay period, the civilian employee loses the allowances.</p><p></p><p>2.  Requests for delays from a civilian employee separating OCONUS to accept private employment OCONUS or to retire locally to establish a retirement residence OCONUS must not be approved.</p><p></p><p>D.  Employment in another DoD Component without a Break in Service after Separation from the Losing Activity.  When a civilian employee separates from a Service or Agency OCONUS and will be employed at a location other than the place where the Government would usually return the civilian employee, the transportation costs are split between the losing activity and the gaining activity.</p><p></p><p>1.  The losing activity OCONUS pays a civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances to the authorized separation destination, limited to those payable to the actual residence, even if the civilian employee is employed, without a break in service, by a different DoD Component after arrival at the authorized separation destination.</p><p></p><p>2.  If the new PDS is other than at the authorized separation destination, thereby requiring additional travel, the gaining DoD Component pays travel and transportation allowances if PCS allowances are authorized.  Payments are limited to the constructed travel by a direct route from the old PDS OCONUS to the new PDS, less the cost of separation travel and transportation allowances paid by the losing activity OCONUS.  If the gaining DoD Component authorizes PCS allowances and the civilian employee meets eligibility requirements, the gaining DoD Component is responsible for the mandatory and any discretionary allowances authorized.  The civilian employee’s actual residence being the separation destination and the new place of employment, without a break in service, does not prevent eligibility for TQSE and MEA.  Applicable PCS allowances are not authorized until the civilian employee signs a new service agreement.</p><p></p><p>3.  When there is no break in service and the move to the new PDS is not in the Government’s interest, there is no authority for other than separation travel and transportation allowances.  If a break in service occurs between the separation date and the employment date, no travel and transportation allowances are payable for travel from the actual residence or authorized alternate separation destination to the new PDS CONUS unless the gaining activity authorizes travel to the first-duty station.</p><p></p><p>054810.  Last Move Home for a Senior Executive Service (SES) Career Appointee upon Separation from Federal Service for Retirement</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  In addition to SES positions, this paragraph applies to a non-SES appointee who has a basic pay rate equal to or higher than Executive Schedule Level V, was previously an SES career appointee, and chose to retain SES retirement travel and transportation allowances under 5 U.S.C. §3392(c).  The last-move-home provisions also apply to eligible dependents of the civilian employee who satisfied the eligibility criteria and either dies in Government service or died after separating from Government service, but before travel or transportation home were completed.  In the case of death in Government service, the civilian employee must have met the requirements for being eligible to receive an annuity as of the date of death.  The civilian employee must not have previously received last-move-home travel and transportation allowances upon separation from Federal service for retirement.  An SES appointee must also meet the following criteria to qualify for travel and transportation allowances:</p><p></p><p>1.  Civilian Employee Requirements.  The civilian employee must be geographically transferred or reassigned in the Government’s interest and at Government expense from one PDS to another as an SES career appointee.  This includes a transfer or reassignment from any of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  One SES career appointment to another.</p><p></p><p>b.  An SES career appointment to an appointment outside the SES at a pay rate equal to or higher than Executive Schedule Level V, and the civilian employee chooses to retain SES retirement travel and transportation allowances under 5 U.S.C. §3392.</p><p></p><p>c.  A position other than an SES career appointment, including an appointment in a civil service position outside the SES, to an SES career appointment.</p><p></p><p>2.  Retirement or Annuity Eligibility.  At the time of transfer or reassignment, the civilian employee must meet any of the following criteria:</p><p></p><p>a.  Eligible, or within 5 years of eligibility, to receive an annuity for optional retirement under 5 U.S.C. §8336 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), or (j) (Civil Service Retirement System); or under 5 U.S.C. §8412 (Federal Employees Retirement System).</p><p></p><p>b.  Eligible to receive an annuity based on discontinued service retirement, disability retirement, or early voluntary retirement under OPM authority, under 5 U.S.C. §8336(d); or 5 U.S.C. §8414(b); or 5 U.S.C. §8410-§8425.</p><p></p><p>B.  Ineligible Civilian Employees.  An SES civilian employee who is a limited-term appointee, limited-emergency appointee, or non-career appointee is ineligible for last-move home allowances upon separation for Federal service or retirement.  A limited-term appointee is a civilian employee appointed under a non-renewable appointment for a term of 3 or fewer years to an SES position and whose duties expire at the end of that term.  A limited-emergency appointee is a civilian employee appointed under a non-renewable appointment, limited to 18 months, to an SES position established to meet a bona fide, unanticipated, and urgent need.  A non-career appointee is a civilian who was selected to fill an SES position and who is not a career appointee, a limited-term appointee, or a limited-emergency appointee.</p><p></p><p>C.  Requesting Authorization or Approval.  A civilian employee who is eligible for relocation expenses may submit a request to the official designated by the DoD Component for expense authorization or approval.  Ordinarily, the civilian employee should submit this request, in writing, at least 90 days before the anticipated retirement date.  The family of a deceased civilian employee should submit a request as soon as practicable after the civilian employee’s death.  The request must include the civilian employee’s name, grade, and Social Security number; the name of any spouse or domestic partner; the names and ages of dependent children; the move origin and destination; and anticipated move dates.</p><p></p><p>D.  Allowable Expenses.  Travel and transportation allowances are authorized for expenses incurred after the civilian employee has separated from Federal service.  Any expenses incurred before actual separation are not reimbursable.  When authorized or approved by the DoD Component head, travel and transportation expenses are paid for an eligible civilian employee.  Allowable expenses and provisions of these regulations that apply are in Table 5-100.  Travel advances are not authorized.  Reimbursement is limited to the policy-constructed airfare for transportation of the civilian employee and eligible dependents.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-100.  Allowances for an SES Appointee’s Last Move Home</p><p>1</p><p>Allowable</p><p>a.  SES appointee transportation expenses.</p><p>b.  SES appointee per diem.</p><p>c.  Dependent transportation.</p><p>d.  MALT if travel is performed by POV.</p><p>e.  HHG transportation and SIT.</p><p>2</p><p>Not Allowable</p><p>a.  Per diem for the civilian employee’s dependents.</p><p>b.  TQSE.</p><p>c.  MEA.</p><p>d.  NTS of HHG.</p><p>e.  Real estate allowances, including lease termination.</p><p>f.  RIT allowance.</p><p>g.  Relocation services.</p><p></p><p>E.  Origin and Destination.  The allowances listed in Table 5-100 may be reimbursed from the civilian employee’s PDS at separation to the place where the civilian employee chooses to reside in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.  Travel and transportation expenses may be paid from an alternate origin or more than one origin, limited to the cost that the Government would have paid if all travel and transportation had originated at the PDS where the civilian employee separated to the place where the civilian employee or the dependents will reside.</p><p></p><p>1.  If the civilian employee dies before separating, or after separating but before the move is completed, expenses may be reimbursed to the place in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS where the dependents choose to reside, even if different than the civilian employee’s selected place.  </p><p></p><p>2.  If the place the civilian employee chooses to reside is within the same general local or metropolitan area that the PDS or residence was located at the time of the civilian employee’s separation, the expenses authorized by this paragraph may not be paid unless the criteria for a short-distance transfer are met.</p><p></p><p>F.  Time Limits.  All travel and transportation must be accomplished within 6 months following the separation date, or the date of death if the civilian employee died before separating.  If an extension is authorized or approved through the Secretarial Process, travel and transportation may be delayed for a longer period in unusual and extenuating circumstances, but in no case longer than 2 years from the effective date of the civilian employee’s separation or the date of death if the civilian employee died before separating.</p><p></p><p>054811.  Retired Civilian Employee Receives Allowances</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee who retires may be eligible to execute standard PCS travel and transportation allowances not used on his or her last PCS if all of the following are met:</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee met the eligibility requirements in section 0537.</p><p></p><p>2.  The civilian employee was authorized standard PCS travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee relocated.</p><p></p><p>4.  The civilian employee completed the required service period.</p><p></p><p>5.  The civilian employee did not use all of his or her authorized travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Time Limit.  An eligible civilian employee is authorized those remaining allowances for the standard time period after reporting for duty.  He or she is eligible for the allowances even after retirement (GSBCA 16494-RELO, November 4, 2004). </p><p></p><p>054812.  PCS Allowances and Transportation in connection with the Death of a Civilian Employee or Dependent</p><p></p><p>DoDD 1300.22 (Mortuary Affairs) specifies the procedures for transporting the remains of a civilian employee or a dependent.</p><p></p><p>A.  Remains of a Civilian Employee.  When a civilian employee dies under any of the following circumstances, payment is authorized for the cost of transporting remains to the civilian employee’s actual residence, PDS, or interment place, limited to the cost to the actual residence or PDS, whichever distance is greater:</p><p></p><p>1.  While on a TDY order. </p><p></p><p>2.  While assigned at a PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>3.  When absent from duty while on leave or on a non-workday when on a TDY or assigned to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>4.  When a civilian employee is reassigned away from the actual residence under a mandatory mobility agreement.</p><p></p><p>5.  When performing official travel duty in direct support for a contingency operation.</p><p></p><p>6.  When performing official duty on an operation in response to an emergency declared by the President.</p><p></p><p>7.  When performing official law enforcement duty as a law enforcement officer in accordance with 5 U.S.C. §5541.</p><p></p><p>B.  Remains of a Civilian Employee’s Dependent.  When a civilian employee’s dependent dies under qualifying circumstances, the DoD Component pays the cost for transporting the dependent’s remains to the dependent’s actual residence, if requested by the civilian employee.  If the civilian employee selects an alternate destination, and the commander, or commander’s designee, approves the alternate destination, the Government’s cost is limited to the cost of transportation to the dependent’s actual residence.  Burial expenses may not be paid when an immediate family member residing with a civilian employee dies while the civilian employee is located OCONUS.  The allowances apply under any of the following circumstances:</p><p></p><p>1.  While residing with the civilian employee OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  While in transit to the PDS OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>3.  While away from a civilian employee’s actual residence due to a mandatory mobility agreement executed as a condition of employment.</p><p></p><p>C.  Dependent, Baggage, and HHG Transportation when a Civilian Employee Dies.  When a civilian employee dies under the circumstances in 054812-A, the deceased civilian employee’s dependents, baggage, and HHG may be transported at Government expense within this subparagraph.  </p><p></p><p>1.  While Performing Duties OCONUS</p><p></p><p>a.  The Government pays the cost of return transportation of a deceased civilian employee’s dependents, baggage, and HHG (including the deceased civilian employee’s HHG).  Transportation costs are for the cost of returning the dependents, baggage, and HHG from the place where official duties were performed (or were to be performed) by the most direct route to the deceased civilian employee’s actual residence.  Transportation may be to any other place designated by the commander or the commander’s designee, but the Government’s cost is limited to the transportation cost to the deceased civilian employee’s actual residence. </p><p></p><p>b.  Dependent travel and HHG transportation must begin within 1 year from the civilian employee’s date of death.  The commander or designee may grant one, and only one, 1-year extension if requested by the family before the end of the initial 1-year limit.</p><p></p><p>c.  Except for the 1-year limit on when transportation must begin, dependent and HHG transportation is the same as for the dependent of a civilian employee eligible for separation travel and transportation from duty OCONUS.  HHG SIT (limited to 60 days with an additional 90 days extension) may be authorized if approved by the Service or Agency, limited to a total of 150 days.</p><p></p><p>2.  While Stationed in the CONUS.  When a civilian employee stationed in the CONUS dies while on a TDY, transportation expenses may not be authorized for a dependent or HHG except while on contingency travel, emergency travel, or performing law enforcement duties.  The deceased civilian employee’s baggage at the TDY location must be transported to the civilian employee’s PDS or actual residence as determined by his or her dependent.</p><p></p><p>3.  Baggage</p><p></p><p>a.  The DoD Component must pay transportation costs to return Government property and the deceased civilian employee’s personal baggage to the civilian employee’s PDS or actual residence.</p><p></p><p>b.  Expenses for transporting baggage by a POV are not reimbursable if they would not have been incurred using a different mode of transportation.</p><p></p><p>c.  Reimbursement for loss or damage to baggage during transit and charges for insurance is not allowed.</p><p></p><p>4.  POV</p><p></p><p>a.  OCONUS.  Transportation of a POV may be authorized if a civilian employee dies while stationed at a PDS OCONUS or while in transit to or from the PDS.  POV transportation may be authorized at Government expense, limited to the cost, including overland transportation, from the civilian employee’s PDS OCONUS to the civilian employee’s actual residence as long as it is established that having the POV at the PDS OCONUS was in the Government’s best interest.</p><p></p><p>b.  CONUS.  When a civilian employee dies while on a TDY in the United States, the civilian employee’s commander, or the commander’s designee, may authorize return shipment expenses for the POV when it is established that the POV was authorized and was in the Government’s best interest (66 Comp. Gen. 677 (1987)).</p><p></p><p>D.  Dependent, Baggage, and HHG Transportation when a Civilian Employee on Contingency Travel, on Emergency Travel, or Performing Law Enforcement Duties Dies. </p><p></p><p>1.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>a.  A civilian employee who dies while performing contingency travel or emergency travel may be authorized travel and transportation allowances if the civilian employee died under the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>(1)  While performing official duties at a location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Within the area of responsibility of the Commander of U.S. Central Command.</p><p></p><p>(3)  In direct support of—or directly related to—a military operation, including a contingency operation or an operation in response to an emergency declared by the President. </p><p></p><p>b.  When a law enforcement officer, as defined in 5 U.S.C. §5541, died on or after June 9, 2010, due to a personal injury sustained while performing law enforcement duties and he or she was either on a TDY or at the current PDS, travel and transportation allowances may be authorized.  </p><p></p><p>c.  Dependent travel, POV transportation, and HHG transportation must begin within 1 year from the civilian employee’s date of death.  The commander, or the commander’s designee, may grant one, and only one, 1-year extension if requested by the family before the end of the initial 1-year limit. </p><p></p><p>2.  Allowances.  When the dependent chooses to relocate to the former actual residence or alternate residence as approved by the commander or the commander’s designee, the following expenses must be authorized: </p><p></p><p>a.  Dependent transportation.</p><p></p><p>b.  HHG transportation, limited to 18,000 pounds.</p><p></p><p>c.  HHG SIT limited to 60 days, with an additional 90 days extension, if approved by the Service or Agency, limited to a total of 150 days. </p><p></p><p>d.  POV transportation costs associated with returning a POV from either of the following:</p><p></p><p>(1)  TDY location to the civilian employee’s PDS, if the Service or Agency authorized the use of the civilian employee’s POV at the TDY location as advantageous to the Government.</p><p></p><p>(2)  PDS OCONUS to the civilian employee’s former actual residence or alternate destination, as approved by the Service or Agency, if the civilian employee’s POV was authorized at the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>E.  Allowances when a Civilian Employee Dies en Route (FTR 303-70).  When a civilian employee dies while en route to a new PDS in the CONUS or after reporting there and the dependent or family was en route to the new PDS or had not started en route travel, the dependent is eligible for PCS allowances.  A DoD Component must continue payment of PCS allowances when the dependent or immediate family chooses to continue the PCS and is included on the civilian employee’s PCS order.</p><p></p><p>1.  All of the following expenses must be authorized:</p><p></p><p>a.  Travel to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  Travel to an alternate destination, selected by the dependent or immediate family, limited to the remaining constructed travel cost to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>c.  TQSE (AE) for 60 or fewer days, based on the per diem rate for an unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner and any other dependent or immediate family member.</p><p></p><p>d.  HHG transportation and POV shipment to the new PDS, the old PDS, or an alternate destination selected by the immediate family, limited to the Government constructed cost between the old PDS and the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>e.  HHG SIT for 90 or fewer days.</p><p></p><p>f.  Reimbursement of real estate expenses due to the PCS.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.  Payment of Expenses</p><p></p><p>a.  Allowable expenses may be paid directly to the person performing the services, or by reimbursement to any person making the original payment.</p><p></p><p>b.  Claims for reimbursement must be supported by required receipts in accordance with financial management procedures.</p><p></p><p>3.  Payment of allowances is prohibited if any other U.S. law authorizes a duplicate payment.  The allowances may not be denied because the deceased civilian employee is eligible for burial benefits as a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces.</p><p></p><p>4.  The DoD Component concerned may pay the following expenses, in addition to the preparation and transportation of remains, incident to the death of a civilian employee who dies while serving with an Armed Force in a contingency operation:</p><p></p><p>a.  The allowances for an escort in par. 032008.</p><p></p><p>b.  Presentation of a U.S. flag to the next of kin.</p><p></p><p>c.  Presentation of a U.S. flag to the civilian employee’s parents that is equal to the flag presented to the next of kin if the next of kin is someone other than the parents.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART G:  SERVICE AGREEMENTS                   (CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES)</p><p></p><p>0549  SERVICE AGREEMENTS (FTR §302-2)</p><p></p><p>054901.  General</p><p></p><p>A service agreement is a written agreement between a civilian employee and the civilian employee’s Agency.  It is prepared according to personnel regulations, and signed by the civilian employee and an authorized Agency representative.  It states that the civilian employee agrees to remain in Government service for a period in par. 054908, after the civilian employee has relocated.  If a civilian employee fails to sign a service agreement, relocation expenses are the civilian employee’s financial responsibility, not the Government’s.  Service agreements must be completed consecutively, and cannot be completed concurrently.  Each agreement is in effect for the period specified in the agreement.  Service agreements that are already in effect cannot be voided by subsequent service agreements.</p><p></p><p>054902.  Disclosure Statement</p><p></p><p>A service agreement must include or have appended a disclosure statement, signed by the civilian employee, before the civilian employee receives any relocation allowances.  The disclosure statement must certify that the civilian employee and any dependents have not and will not accept duplicate reimbursement for the relocation expenses.  It must certify that, to the best of the civilian employee’s knowledge, no third party has accepted duplicate reimbursement for the relocation expenses.  </p><p></p><p>054903.  Actual Residence</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee who accepts a transfer to a PDS OCONUS must provide the Service or Agency with the information needed to determine the civilian employee’s actual residence to document in the service agreement.  The requirements in this paragraph are also used to determine the actual residence in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS.  The location of the actual residence must be documented in the civilian employee’s official personnel folder.  The determination of the actual residence depends on the facts presented and is determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p></p><p>A.  Appointees and Student Trainees.  Authorized transportation to the first PDS must be from the appointee’s actual residence at the time of selection or assignment.  The actual residence is the location where the appointee lived before selection for the appointment or assignment.  If the appointee claims another location as the actual residence at the time of selection, the appointee must prove that the residence where the appointee lived at the time of selection is temporary and the actual residence is elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>B.  Employment OCONUS.  Actual residence must be determined when an individual initially is appointed or transferred to a PDS OCONUS.  The Government’s obligation for travel and transportation allowances is limited to movement to and from a civilian employee’s actual residence at the time of assignment to duty OCONUS, when the travel is to a PDS OCONUS upon assignment, when it is round-trip travel under a renewal agreement, or when it is return travel for separation.  If, at the time of appointment, the civilian employee is in the area OCONUS temporarily (for example, as a tourist), the civilian employee subsequently may be eligible for return travel and transportation allowances or RAT.  Before an agreement is negotiated, the employment office must state the actual residence in the agreement.  The actual residence shown in an initial service agreement must be the same as in the renewal agreement.  If the initial agreement was incorrect, the correct actual residence must be determined, explained, and stated in the renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>1.  Consideration Factors.  Ordinarily, the actual residence is a fixed residence.  This can be the place from which transferred or appointed or where a dependent and HHG are at the time of an individual’s appointment or transfer to a position OCONUS.  The request of an appointee or civilian employee to specify a location that he or she cannot justify as the actual residence to establish residence at, or to visit, a certain location must not be a basis for designating that place as the actual residence.  Consider carefully all facts concerning the civilian employee’s residence before assignment to duty OCONUS, including all of the following:</p><p></p><p>a.  Home ownership.</p><p></p><p>b.  Previous residence.</p><p></p><p>c.  Temporary employment in the city where recruited.</p><p></p><p>d.  Employment requiring residence apart from the family.</p><p></p><p>e.  The civilian employee’s voting residence.</p><p></p><p>f.  The jurisdictions to which the civilian employee pays taxes.</p><p></p><p>g.  In the case of a local hire, the length of absence from the claimed place of residence, the reasons for such absence, and whether a residence has been maintained to which the individual expects to return.</p><p></p><p>h.  Actual residence in an area in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS could be negated when the individual has established local residence OCONUS, participated in local elections, or obtained waiver of U.S. tax liability based on foreign residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  Change in Actual Residence.  When the actual residence is determined, a change is not authorized during a continuous period of service OCONUS and may not be approved except in case of an error.  Errors must be corrected in the agreement to show the civilian employee’s correct actual residence.</p><p></p><p>054904.  Service Agreement Requirements (FTR §302-2)</p><p></p><p>Agreement requirements are premised on the civilian employee’s status as outlined in the following tables.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-101.  No Service Agreement Required</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>an individual is employed initially at a PDS OCONUS and does not meet service agreement eligibility requirements, </p><p>no service agreement </p><p>is required.</p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS serving under a service agreement completes the full tour of duty and is returning to the CONUS where he or she is employed without a break in service with the same or another DoD Component that does not authorize PCS allowances,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS completes a full tour of duty under a service agreement and returns to the actual residence in the CONUS for separation from Government service,</p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 5-102.  Service Agreement Requirements</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS serving under a service agreement completes the full tour of duty and is returning to the CONUS where the civilian employee is employed without a break in service with the same or another DoD Component that does authorize PCS allowances,</p><p>a service agreement is required to serve for 12 months in Government service from the date of reporting for duty at the new PDS, and he or she is authorized separation travel.</p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS initially meets the eligibility requirements in a service agreement,</p><p>a service agreement is required for the tour of duty applicable to the PDS OCONUS where employed.  The agreement concerns separation travel, specific instances of transportation for eligible dependents or HHG from the actual residence, and renewal agreement eligibility.</p><p>3</p><p>an individual is initially employed by DoD at a PDS OCONUS and meets eligibility requirements in a service agreement and prior service credit requirements OCONUS,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement to serve for 12 months from the date of employment, or a period that equals the full tour of duty for the area when added to a military or civilian period of service occurring immediately before the hire, whichever is greater.  The agreement concerns separation travel, in specific instances transportation for eligible dependents or HHG from the actual residence, and renewal agreement eligibility.</p><p>4</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS has not completed an initial tour and is transferred to a new PDS of a different DoD Component within the same or a different geographical location OCONUS,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement to serve for 12 months from the date of reporting to duty at the new PDS or the difference between the tour of duty at the old PDS and the initial tour of duty at the new PDS, whichever is greater.  The agreement concerns PCS allowances, separation travel, and renewal agreement eligibility.</p><p>5</p><p>a civilian employee is employed initially by DoD at a PDS OCONUS and is not serving under a service agreement and is then transferred to a new PDS within the same geographical location OCONUS, either within the same or to a different DoD Component,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement is required to serve for 12 months from date of reporting for duty at the new PDS.  The agreement concerns eligibility for PCS allowances to the new PDS.  There is no other eligibility.</p><p>6</p><p>a civilian employee is employed initially by DoD at a PDS OCONUS and is not serving under a service agreement and is then transferred to a new PDS in a different geographical location OCONUS, either within the same or to a different DoD Component,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement to serve for 12 months from the date reporting to duty at the new PDS or the difference between the tour of duty at the old PDS and the initial tour of duty at the new PDS, whichever is greater.  The agreement concerns PCS allowances, separation travel, and renewal agreement eligibility.</p><p>7</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS is serving under a service agreement and is reassigned or transferred to a new PDS at the same geographical location either within the same or to a different DoD Component,</p><p>the current service agreement continues in effect for all eligibility purposes, and a new 12-month service agreement is required for PCS allowances to be authorized to the new PDS if less than 12 months of service remain under the current agreement and PCS costs are incurred.*</p><p> *A release from the tour-of-duty requirement for the Government’s convenience without penalty provisions applies to any incomplete service under the new 12-month agreement when allowing authorization upon completion of tour of duty under the old agreement in effect at the time of reassignment or transfer.  If the civilian employee does not complete the tour of duty at the new PDS and the Government does not release him or her from the service agreement, the civilian employee may be required to repay the Government for the PCS expenses to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-103.  Service Agreement when RAT Involved</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS completes a full tour of duty, does not perform RAT, and is transferred to a new PDS in the same geographical location OCONUS within the same DoD Component,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement to serve for 12 months from the date of reporting for duty at the new PDS.  The service agreement concerns PCS allowances only and authorization under the completed tour of duty agreement remains unchanged.</p><p>2</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS completes a full tour of duty, does not perform RAT, and is transferred to a new PDS in a different geographical location OCONUS within the same DoD Component,</p><p>the civilian employee must sign a service agreement to serve for either 12 months from the date of reporting for duty at the new PDS or the initial or renewal tour of duty, as applicable, at the new PDS, less the tour of duty served at the old PDS.  The service agreement concerns PCS allowances, separation travel, and renewal agreement eligibility.</p><p>3</p><p>a civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS who completes the full tour of duty, performs RAT, and returns to the same or a different PDS OCONUS within the same or to a different DoD Component,</p><p>a renewal service agreement is required.  The tour of duty under the new agreement must be the tour of duty applicable for the area where the PDS, upon return, is located.</p><p></p><p>054905.  Documentation</p><p></p><p>Services and Agencies must maintain a record in the civilian employee’s official personnel folder of transportation and storage authority, authorizations, and limitations.  Record maintenance is limited to information and for the time period necessary to meet the requirements and restrictions in this Part.  Record material may be removed when it no longer applies.</p><p>054906.  Preparation and Disposition</p><p></p><p>Statutory authority requires that a civilian employee complete a service agreement to establish his or her eligibility for certain travel and transportation allowances for PDT.  Service agreement forms, DD Form 1616 (OCONUS Transportation Agreement for School Personnel), DD Form 1617 (OCONUS Transportation Agreement for Civilian Employees) , and DD Form 1618 (CONUS Transportation Agreement for Civilian Employees) .</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Agreement for Civilian Employees other than School Teachers OCONUS.  DD Form 1617 (OCONUS Transportation Agreement for Civilian Employees), is used in connection with any of the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee transfers or is assigned to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A new appointee is appointed to position OCONUS (see par. 054801 concerning appointments and assignments to the first PDS).</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee with a renewal agreement who uses round-trip travel to take leave between consecutive tours of employment OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>4.  The return transportation of eligible local hires OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Transfer of Professional School Personnel OCONUS.  DD Form 1616 (OCONUS Transportation Agreement for School Personnel) is used when DODEA teachers perform a PCS.</p><p></p><p>C.  Transfer of Civilian Employees to and within the CONUS.  DD Form 1618 (CONUS Transportation Agreement for Civilian Employees) is used when a civilian employee transfers to or within the CONUS, including an appointee or student trainee eligible for travel to the first PDS in the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>054907.  Initial and Renewal Agreements</p><p></p><p>A.  Types of Agreements.  An initial agreement establishes eligibility for a civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances, dependents, and HHG.  A renewal agreement establishes eligibility for round-trip travel and transportation allowances for a civilian employee and dependents for taking leave between consecutive periods of employment OCONUS, but does not establish any HHG transportation authority.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Authorized Negotiators.  Personnel designated by the DoD Component concerned must negotiate agreements.  For all DoD Components, any of the following have authority to negotiate agreements:</p><p></p><p>1.  Commanding officers, and their civilian counterparts having appointing authority to fill positions.</p><p></p><p>2.  Any civilian personnel office civilian employee designated to act for a commanding officer in effecting appointments.</p><p></p><p>3.  Other personnel designated by the commanding officer to act for the commanding officer in response to specific requests.</p><p></p><p>4.  A local commander in a foreign area may negotiate an initial agreement with a locally hired civilian employee if the requirements in Table 5-104 are met.</p><p></p><p>5.  A local commander in a non-foreign area OCONUS may negotiate an initial agreement with a locally hired person for recruitment purposes if the requirements in Table 5-104 are met, but only if qualified local applicants are not readily available for the position.</p><p>054908.  Initial Agreement</p><p></p><p>A.  Initial Agreements Required.  The following civilian employees require initial negotiated agreements: </p><p></p><p>1.  A new appointee to a first PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A student trainee assigned on completion of college work to a first PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  A civilian employee transferred or reassigned from one PDS OCONUS to another PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>4.  A new appointee recruited for service OCONUS at a geographical location other than where the actual residence is located.</p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee transferred to and within the CONUS.</p><p></p><p>6.  A civilian employee transferred to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>7.  A civilian employee recruited OCONUS for assignment to a PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Locally Hired Civilian Employee OCONUS.  An initial agreement is a recruitment incentive, not an entitlement, for locally hiring a civilian employee with an actual residence in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS, outside the PDS geographical location, to accept Federal employment in an area OCONUS.  An individual is not automatically granted an initial agreement when he or she meets eligibility requirements.</p><p></p><p>1.  Initial Service Agreement Requirements.  The commanding officer, or the commanding officer’s designee, must determine that another candidate would have to be transferred or appointed from outside the local area to fill the position involved unless an initial agreement is offered to a locally hired candidate.  A locally hired candidate is ineligible for an initial agreement if the position is one for which out-of-country recruitment is not normally undertaken.  At the time of appointment or assignment, or when eligibility for return travel is lost, the locally hired candidate must be able to prove actual residence in the CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS.  The residence must be outside the PDS geographical location.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-104.  Mandatory Service Agreement Requirements </p><p>for Eligible Locally Hired Civilian Employees</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>a locally hired civilian employee is a former military member,</p><p>he or she must be both:</p><p>a.  Separated or retired locally within the foreign country OCONUS where the civilian position is located to which the individual is appointed while serving in a foreign area OCONUS.</p><p>b.  Appointed to a vacant, appropriated-fund civilian position before expiration of that individual’s authorization for return travel and transportation to an area in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS accruing from the prior military service.</p><p>2</p><p>the foreign-area command OCONUS determines that a civilian employee of another Federal Department, Agency, or instrumentality, Government contractor, Red Cross, non-appropriated-fund activity, international organization in which the United States participates, and any other activity or Agency is operating in support of the United States or its personnel in the area,</p><p>the individual must meet all of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>a.  Be recruited in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS under employment conditions that provided for return travel and transportation allowances.</p><p>b.  Be committed to a specific vacant position before separation from prior employment.</p><p>c.  Be appointed no later than 1 month after termination of such employment.</p><p>3</p><p>a former civilian employee of the same or another Federal Department or Agency was separated by a RIF during the previous 6 months, is on a reemployment priority list, and has been authorized delay in return travel for the primary purpose of exercising reemployment priority rights,</p><p></p><p>4</p><p>an individual, who accompanied or followed a spouse to the foreign area OCONUS and, at the time of hiring, had authorization for return transportation as a dependent of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a civilian Government civilian employee serving under an initial agreement providing for return travel, and the spouse is no longer the sponsor,*</p><p></p><p> *Reasons a spouse would no longer be the sponsor: the spouse dies, the spouse becomes physically or mentally incapable of continued Government employment, the spouse permanently departs the post or area, or due to divorce or legal separation.  A legal separation exists when either the civilian employee or the spouse initiates legal action to dissolve the marriage or one separates from bed and board short of applying for a divorce.</p><p></p><p>2.  Eligibility Determination.  Eligibility for travel and transportation allowances for dependents or HHG from the civilian employee’s actual residence to the foreign PDS OCONUS or return transportation to the actual residence must be determined at the time of appointment or when the civilian employee loses eligibility for return travel and transportation allowances.  The eligibility decision must be recorded in the initial agreement.  </p><p></p><p>3.  Travel and Transportation Authorization.  A locally hired civilian employee OCONUS granted an initial agreement is authorized the same travel and transportation allowances as a civilian employee transferred or appointed from the CONUS.  </p><p></p><p>4.  Renewal Agreement </p><p></p><p>a.  A renewal agreement must not be negotiated with a locally hired civilian employee who was in the geographical location OCONUS because his or her spouse is there as a member of a uniformed Service, a State Department Foreign Service member, a private individual, or a civilian employee of a private individual or non-Federal organization.</p><p></p><p>b.  A renewal agreement must not be negotiated with a locally hired civilian employee who is unmarried and under age 21 whose parent is in the geographical location OCONUS as a member of a uniformed Service, a State Department Foreign Service member, a private individual, or a civilian employee of a private individual or a non-Federal organization.</p><p></p><p>054909.  Renewal Agreement Negotiation</p><p></p><p>A.  Civilian Employees.  A renewal agreement is negotiated with a civilian employee who has an initial agreement when the tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS is completed satisfactorily and who has an actual residence outside the geographical employment locality.  A renewal agreement must not be negotiated due to RAT denial or delay.</p><p></p><p>B.  Married Civilian Employees.  When a married couple are both civilian employees in the same locality OCONUS, a renewal agreement is negotiated either separately or with one as head of the household and the other treated as a spouse.  Both spouses must sign a written statement agreeing to the decision.  A copy is filed in each civilian employee’s personnel folder.  If negotiated separately, neither civilian employee may be treated as a spouse and a dependent may not benefit twice.  A civilian employee who chooses travel and transportation allowances as a spouse does not forfeit authorized allowances for return travel accrued under an initial agreement.  When spouses have independently earned travel and transportation allowances and chose for one to be treated as a dependent, and the employment of the head-of-household ceases in the Federal Government, the still-employed spouse may revert to the agreement in force before the decision.  This allows the still-employed spouse to negotiate RAT, if eligible.  In computing the time limits for required service, the time begins when the civilian employee returns to the location OCONUS from the last renewal-agreement trip, either under the civilian employee’s or the spouse’s agreement, whichever trip under the agreement ends later (54 Comp. Gen. 814 (1975)).</p><p></p><p>054910.  Tour of Duty Requirement</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee must complete a minimum period of service when transferred to any PDS or when performing RAT.  Tours of duty are established by the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (PDUSD (P&amp;R)) for DoD civilian employees in localities OCONUS.  A standard tour of duty in an area OCONUS is 36 months for an initial agreement and 24 months under a renewal agreement.  See Tour Lengths and Tours of Duty OCONUS for specific guidance on instructions, locations, and exceptions for tours of duty.</p><p></p><p>Table 5-105.  Minimum Periods of Service</p><p>If a civilian employee…</p><p>Then the minimum tour of duty is…</p><p>1</p><p>transfers in the CONUS, </p><p>at least 12 months following the transfer’s effective date.</p><p>2</p><p>receives an appointment or assignment to a first PDS in the CONUS or non-foreign area OCONUS,</p><p></p><p>3</p><p>transfers OCONUS,</p><p>at least 12 months following the effective date of transfer, but no more than 36 months, as agreed upon.</p><p>4</p><p>is a DoDEA teacher,</p><p>at least 1 school year, as determined under 20 U.S.C. §901-§907.</p><p>5</p><p>performs RAT,</p><p>at least 12 months from the return date to the same or different PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>A.  Administratively Reduced Tours.  A 24-month tour of duty may be administratively reduced by 2 months for a civilian employee signing a renewal agreement to serve an additional tour of duty at the same or another post.  A 36-month tour of duty may be reduced up to 6 months to begin RAT if the renewal agreement is for duty in a 24-month tour of duty area.  Except as specified in par. 054910-C, when an agreed tour of duty of 24 or 36 months is administratively reduced, the tour of duty under a renewal agreement increases by the length of the reduction.  Use of a reduced tour of duty is authorized to permit scheduling leave at regular intervals, such as known low-intensity periods or during school-vacation periods for a civilian employee with a dependent attending school OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Administratively Extended Tours of Duty.  A 24- or 36-month tour of duty may be extended, allowing a civilian employee to perform RAT after the extended tour.  Except as specified in par. 054910-C, the length of the renewal tour of duty must be the greater of 12 months or 24 months, minus the tour of duty completed under the initial agreement extension.  A DoD Component cannot extend an initial agreement to eliminate a civilian employee’s authorization for separation travel and transportation allowances.  After the civilian employee has served the minimum period in the initial agreement, statutory authority provides separation travel and transportation allowances.  The civilian employee and the DoD component authority must sign the initial agreement extension (see B-199643, September 30, 1981).</p><p></p><p>C.  Length of Renewal Tour of Duty for a Civilian Employee Subject to the 5-Year Limitation OCONUS.  When an initial 36-month agreement is reduced by up to 6 months for a civilian employee subject to the 5-year limitation OCONUS, the renewal agreement must specify a tour of duty that, when added to the number of months completed under the initial agreement, plus the number of months authorized as leave in the renewal agreement, equals 60 months.  A 36-month tour of duty may be extended, allowing a civilian employee to perform RAT after the extended tour of duty, provided the civilian employee serves at least 12 months after returning to the area OCONUS.  The renewal tour of duty must be equal to 60 months (5 years) minus the sum of the:</p><p></p><p>1.  Tour of duty completed under an initial agreement.</p><p></p><p>2.  Tour of duty completed under the extension of the initial agreement. </p><p></p><p>3.  The greater of 12 months or the time authorized as leave for the renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>D.  Civilian Employee Released from 5-Year Limitation OCONUS.  If the 5-year limitation OCONUS is extended so the civilian employee can perform RAT following completion of the initial tour of duty and an initial tour extension, the length of the renewal tour of duty is determined in par. 054910-B.  The renewal tour of duty must be the greater of 12 months or 24 months minus the time completed under the initial tour extension.</p><p></p><p>E.  Civilian Employee Serves Additional Tour of Duty after the 5-Year Limitation OCONUS.  The length of any renewal tour of duty served after the 5-year limitation is determined in par. 054910-A and par. 054910-B.  However, a 12-month renewal tour of duty cannot be reduced for a civilian employee signing a renewal agreement to serve an additional tour at the same or another post (37 Comp. Gen. 62 (1957)).  DoD component policies on extensions OCONUS beyond 5 years must be applied according to this paragraph and par. 054206.</p><p></p><p>F.  Credit for Prior Service.  The following personnel must serve the employing DoD Component for 1 year (1 school year for DoDEA teachers) from the employment date of the service agreement or a time period that, when added to their immediate prior civilian or military service before signing the agreement, totals the tour of duty for the area, whichever is greater.  </p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee who was appointed by transfer from another Agency, whose immediate prior service has been in an area OCONUS, and who transfers without performing RAT.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Service member who separates locally to accept Government employment with a negotiated service agreement. </p><p></p><p>3.  A Government-contractor civilian employee who separates locally to accept Government employment with a negotiated service agreement. </p><p></p><p>4.  A locally hired dependent of a Service member or civilian employee with a negotiated service agreement. </p><p></p><p>5.  A civilian employee of an international organization in which the U.S. Government participates, who is separated OCONUS to accept DoD employment with a negotiated service agreement.</p><p></p><p>6.  A non-appropriated fund civilian employee who separates OCONUS to accept other DoD employment with a negotiated service agreement under the requirements in par. 054908-B2. </p><p></p><p>7.  An individual reemployed from a priority placement list with a service agreement negotiated as in par. 054908-B2.</p><p></p><p>G.  Reassignment or Transfer in Same Geographical Location.</p><p></p><p>1.  No PCS Costs.  When a civilian employee is reassigned within a DoD Component or transferred to another DoD Component in the same geographical location OCONUS, does not complete the tour of duty, and incurs no PCS costs, the tour of duty, in the service agreement at the time of reassignment or transfer, remains in effect.  At the completion of the tour of duty, the civilian employee is eligible for return travel and transportation allowances for separation or renewal agreement negotiation, regardless of how long the civilian employee has served the activity to which reassigned or transferred (see par. 054902).</p><p></p><p>2.  PCS Costs Incurred.  A new service agreement for a minimum of 12 months is required for authorization of PCS allowances to the new PDS if all of the following conditions apply to a civilian employee:</p><p></p><p>a.  Is reassigned within a DoD component or transferred to another DoD component in the same geographical location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>b.  Does not complete the tour of duty.  However, the tour of duty in the service agreement at the time of reassignment or transfer remains in effect for return travel and transportation allowances for separation or renewal agreement negotiation.</p><p></p><p>c.  At the time of reassignment or transfer has less than 12 months remaining under the existing service agreement after reporting for duty at the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>d.  Incurs PCS costs.</p><p></p><p>H.  Reassignment to Different Geographical Location OCONUS.  A civilian employee at a PDS OCONUS without a service agreement who is reassigned within a DoD Component or transferred to another DoD Component to a different geographical location OCONUS is required to negotiate a service agreement for the full tour of duty for the new PDS.  When a civilian employee is serving under a service agreement at a PDS OCONUS, is reassigned within a DoD Component or transferred to another DoD Component in a different geographical location OCONUS, and does not complete the tour of duty, credit is given for service completed at the old PDS.  A new agreement is required with a new 12-month tour of duty or the difference between the new PDS tour of duty and the time completed at the old PDS, whichever is greater.</p><p></p><p>1.  The new service agreement concerns PCS allowances to the new PDS and any additional separation travel and transportation allowances from the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The service agreement tour of duty at the time of reassignment or transfer remains in effect for return travel and transportation allowances for separation from the old PDS or for renewal-agreement negotiation.</p><p></p><p>3.  Before performing RAT, the civilian employee must sign a renewal agreement to serve a tour of duty applicable to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>I.  Civilian Employee Not Needed for Full Tour of Duty.  When it is known in advance that a civilian employee is not needed for the full tour of duty OCONUS, employment may be for a lesser period without affecting travel and transportation allowances to the PDS OCONUS and return for the purpose of separation (26 Comp. Gen. 488 (1947)).  The service agreement must specify a 12-month tour of duty according to Title 5 U.S.C. §5722.  Employment may be terminated when the civilian employee’s services are no longer required.</p><p></p><p>J.  Effect of Increased or Decreased Tour of Duty.  When a tour of duty increases for an area OCONUS, the tour of duty in a currently assigned civilian employee’s service agreement remains unchanged.  The increased tour of duty only affects any civilian employee who executes an agreement after the date the increased tour of duty is approved.  If a tour of duty decreases, the shorter tour of duty applies to any currently assigned civilian employee whose service agreement provides for a longer tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>K.  Modified Tour of Duty Type.  If a civilian employee executing an unaccompanied tour requests approval from the appropriate authority to change the tour of duty type to an accompanied tour, the tour of duty must be the greater of either 12 months or the accompanied tour for that location, minus the tour of duty completed or served under the initial unaccompanied agreement.</p><p> </p><p>054911.  Starting Tour of Duty</p><p></p><p>Table 5-106.  Starting Tour of Duty</p><p>If a civilian employee…</p><p>Then the tour of duty begins on the date…</p><p>1</p><p>transfers to or between PDSs in the CONUS,</p><p>the civilian employee reports for duty at the new PDS.</p><p>2</p><p>receives a first-duty station in the United States,</p><p>the appointee reports for duty at the PDS.</p><p>3</p><p>is recruited for an initial agreement outside the geographical location of an activity OCONUS, </p><p>the individual reports at the activity OCONUS.</p><p>4</p><p>is recruited for an initial agreement locally OCONUS,</p><p>the individual begins duty.</p><p>5</p><p>had accompanied or followed a spouse to a foreign area OCONUS and, at the time of hiring, had authorization for return transportation as a dependent of a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a civilian Government civilian employee serving under an initial agreement providing for return travel, and the spouse is no longer the sponsoring spouse,</p><p>the locally hired individual executes the agreement.</p><p>6</p><p>signs a renewal agreement for a tour of duty OCONUS,</p><p>he or she reports for duty at the PDS OCONUS following completion of RAT unless the RAT travel is delayed and authorized or approved to be performed within a tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>054912.  Acceptable Reasons for Release from a Tour of Duty</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee, serving under a service agreement at any PDS, may be released from the tour of duty requirement specified in the agreement for reasons beyond the civilian employee’s control that are acceptable to the DoD component.  The commanding officer, or the commanding officers designee, at the civilian employee’s assigned activity must determine acceptability.  The nature, extent, and necessity required by the situation must be established to the determining official’s satisfaction.  Verification must be received from a reliable and trustworthy source, such as private, state, or local welfare agencies; an attending physician; or a local cleric.</p><p></p><p>A.  Acceptable Reasons.  Acceptable reasons for a release from tour of duty requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p></p><p>1.  Illness not induced by misconduct.</p><p></p><p>2.  Enlistment or call to active duty in the Armed Forces.</p><p></p><p>3.  Exercise of statutory re-employment rights within a time limitation that precludes completion of a tour of duty. </p><p></p><p>4.  Release for the Government’s convenience, for example, separation due to physical or mental disqualification, lack of skill to perform duties for which recruited or any other duties that the civilian employee could be assigned.  A civilian employee separated due to illness induced by misconduct or due to misconduct is not separated for the Government’s convenience.</p><p></p><p>5.  Separation due to a RIF.</p><p>6.  When a civilian employee’s services are not required for the entire tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>B.  Acceptable Reasons OCONUS.  In addition to the general reasons, the following are acceptable reasons for a civilian employee OCONUS:</p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee’s immediate presence is required in the geographical location where the actual residence is located due to an unforeseen emergency.</p><p></p><p>2.  Completion of the agreed tour of duty would result in extreme personal hardship due to circumstances beyond the civilian employee’s control, such as conditions seriously affecting the health, welfare, and safety of the civilian employee, serious illness or death in the immediate family, or the imminent breakup of the family group.</p><p></p><p>3.  Significant changes occur in the civilian employee’s employment situation or loss of economic benefits.</p><p></p><p>C.  Released to Continue Employment.  A civilian employee, serving under a service agreement who transfers to another DoD Component or Agency, must be released from the tour of duty requirement in the civilian employee’s current agreement, unless transferring to another DoD Component within 12 months of reporting to the PDS on a PCS move (see par. 053706-A).  If the transfer involves PCS allowances to a new PDS, the gaining activity is responsible for all PCS costs.  The civilian employee must continue in Government service for at least 12 months after he or she reported at the PDS where departing to satisfy the obligation for costs incurred by the losing activity in moving the civilian employee to that PDS.</p><p></p><p>054913.  Service Agreement Violation</p><p></p><p>An individual who violates a service agreement by failing to meet or comply with the requirements specified is ineligible for travel and transportation allowances and may be indebted and subject to collection action.  A violation includes failure to meet or comply with the requirements in an agreement for reasons unacceptable to the employing activity.  Violations also include, but are not limited to failure to report for duty, failure to return to the country or geographical location where the actual residence is located in connection with RAT, or failure to use travel and transportation allowances within a reasonable time after separation.  A civilian employee or appointee who violates a service agreement, other than for reasons beyond his or her control that are acceptable to the Service or Agency, must reimburse the Government all costs paid for relocation expenses paid based on that service agreement, including a withholding tax allowance and a RIT allowance. (FTR §302-2)</p><p></p><p>A.  Responsibilities.  A civilian employee is responsible for reporting to the designated PDS.  If the civilian employee does not arrive at the new PDS, resigns, or arrives at the new PDS and refuses to perform the mission, he or she is required to repay any PDT allowances that the Government has already reimbursed.  The civilian employee also may be indebted to the Government for travel, transportation, and relocation expenses incurred on behalf of a civilian employee under other circumstances in this Chapter (CBCA 3804-RELO, June 24, 2014.  The appropriate civilian personnel officer must notify the finance, fiscal, or disbursing officer when a civilian employee violates a service agreement.  The appropriate personnel officer must determine if PCS allowances must be repaid before processing a civilian employee’s separation.  The appropriate finance, fiscal, or dispersing officer provides a copy of the Statement of Liability or Credit to the civilian personnel officer, who includes it in the civilian employee’s official personnel folder.  The appropriate finance, fiscal, or disbursing officer must determine a civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances before processing the civilian employee’s separation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Violation Occurs.  If a violation occurs, the activity where the violation occurred must compute travel and transportation allowances previously furnished or to be furnished.  In each instance of a service agreement violation, the finance, fiscal, or disbursing officer must provide the civilian employee with a statement of his or her liability or credit that states, in detail, the liabilities, credits, an explanation of how the credits may be used or applied, and other obligations.  That officer must send a copy of the statement provided to the civilian employee to the civilian personnel officer for inclusion in the civilian employee’s personnel folder.  The finance, fiscal, or dispersing officer must inform the civilian employee of the right to file a claim if he or she disagrees with the liability or credit statement.  A sample statement and examples of calculations in cases of renewal-agreement violations during the first and second years of an additional tour appear on the DTMO website.  If the finance, fiscal, or disbursing officer determines that a civilian employee is indebted to the Government, the officer must immediately initiate collection according to appropriate finance directives.</p><p></p><p>C.  Transfers to, from, and within the CONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  A service agreement provision for a transfer to, from, or within the CONUS that requires 12 months of service following the effective date of transfer is not voided by either of the following: </p><p></p><p>a.  A subsequent transfer within that period, whether at the civilian employee’s request or in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>b.  Another service agreement being signed incident to a subsequent transfer.</p><p></p><p>2.  The service agreement’s time limit is waived if the civilian employee fails to comply with the requirement for reasons beyond his or her control for reasons acceptable to the employing Department or Agency.  In that case, the civilian employee has no liability.  The time limit for each service agreement violated must be waived separately.</p><p></p><p>D.  Agreement Violations for a Civilian Employee OCONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  Violation during the First Year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement.  A civilian employee OCONUS who leaves Government service for reasons unacceptable to the last assigned Agency before completing 12 months of service under the initial service agreement is financially responsible to the Government for travel and transportation allowances and associated costs for the move to that PDS.  These include the travel and transportation allowances for the civilian employee, eligible dependents, HHG (including SIT and NTS) a POV, and a mobile home.  Return travel is the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  A civilian employee who departs from a PDS OCONUS for authorized leave, with or without pay, before the end of the first year of an initial service agreement, and resigns while away for reasons unacceptable to the Agency, is allowed credit for the authorized leave time toward completion of the minimum service requirement (see B-184948, November 18, 1975).  The provisions of this paragraph apply to each civilian employee OCONUS.  Additional penalties may apply to a DODEA teacher.</p><p></p><p>2.  Violation after 1 year of Service under an Initial Service Agreement.  A civilian employee who completes 1 year of an assignment OCONUS and, for reasons unacceptable to the employing DoD component, fails to satisfy an initial service agreement greater than 1 year is not financially responsible for the travel and transportation cost and related allowances associated with the move to the PDS OCONUS, except for charges for NTS of HHG incurred after the end of the first year.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for all HHG transportation costs after the violation date and must be advised immediately.  He or she is not authorized return POV transportation and may not be provided Government-funded commercial transportation.  If the civilian employee has insufficient funds, he or she may be authorized repatriation transportation.</p><p></p><p>3.  Civilian Employee Serving under Renewal Agreements </p><p></p><p>a.  When a civilian employee fails to complete 1 year of service under a renewal agreement, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the costs of any of the following: </p><p></p><p>(1)  Transportation and per diem for the civilian employee and transportation for eligible dependents from the former PDS to the actual residence and from the actual residence to the last PDS where he or she failed to complete 1 year of service.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Transportation for any dependent who traveled between the former PDS and the last PDS without going to the civilian employee’s actual residence.</p><p></p><p>(3)  HHG transportation, including SIT, from the former PDS to the last PDS.</p><p></p><p>(4)  POV transportation or NTS of the HHG, unless an earned allowance exists for the NTS of the HHG or return transportation of the POV. </p><p></p><p>(5)  The MEA paid for a transfer from a former to the last PDS.</p><p></p><p>b.  The civilian employee is authorized certain unused allowances accrued under a prior service agreement under which the civilian employee completed the agreed-upon service period.  These include personal transportation and the transportation of dependents and HHG (including SIT) from the PDS where the service requirement was satisfied to the actual residence.  When the civilian employee is separated from Government service, he or she may apply his or her unused allowances to return travel.  If the amount of the unused allowances is less than the costs to return to the actual residence, the difference is the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.  Although the difference is the civilian employee’s financial responsibility, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation, but must collect the difference from the civilian employee.  If the amount of the unused allowances is greater than or equal to the costs to return to the actual residence, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation in full.  The civilian employee may choose to pay the total costs and submit a reimbursement claim for the applicable amount.  Additional penalties for DODEA teachers may apply.</p><p></p><p>c.  If a civilian employee serves 1 or more years under a renewal agreement, but does not serve the entire period in the renewal agreement, the separation has the following effects on a civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances.</p><p></p><p>(1)  The civilian employee is not liable for travel and transportation allowances from the PDS where the civilian employee completed the previous tour to the actual residence.  He or she also is not liable for traveling from the actual residence to the PDS where the civilian employee failed to complete the agreed-upon tour.  The civilian employee does not have to repay the direct travel of dependents and HHG shipment (including SIT) between the PDS where the civilian employee failed to complete the service agreement and the previous PDS where the civilian employee satisfied the previous service agreement.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If the PDS is different from the one where the civilian employee completed the previous tour, then the civilian employee is financially responsible for the costs of his or her transportation and the transportation of dependents and HHG from the PDS where the civilian employee did not complete the agreed-upon tour under the renewal agreement to the actual residence.  If the civilian employee was separated from Government service, then the following apply:</p><p></p><p>(a)  Credit an amount to the civilian employee equal to the costs of transporting his or her HHG and any dependents who did not accompany the civilian employee to the actual residence for leave from the former PDS where the service requirement was completed.</p><p></p><p>(b)  The credited amount is limited to the costs of travel for a civilian employee’s dependents and the cost of shipping HHG to the actual residence from the former PDS.</p><p></p><p>(c)  Compute these credits and any remaining liability as specified in par. 054914.</p><p></p><p>4.  DoDEA Teacher.  In addition to the other penalties for violation of agreements, a DoDEA teacher who fails to report for service at the beginning of the next school year is financially responsible to the employing military Department for the reasonable value of any storage provided during the recess period.</p><p></p><p>5.  Loss of Travel and Transportation Allowances under an Agreement.  If a dependent’s status changes, such as when a dependent reaches age 21, a civilian employee may lose eligibility for dependent travel and transportation allowances under a service agreement or may be indebted and subject to collection action for travel and transportation already furnished.  If travel and transportation allowances are duplicated under separate statutes, the civilian employee is indebted and subject to collection action for any duplicate payments that he or she received.</p><p></p><p>054914.  Computation of Liabilities and Credits</p><p></p><p>Computations of a civilian employee’s liabilities and credits, including those remaining from previous tours of duty, must be based on actual costs or constructed costs, such as the rates applicable at the time the civilian employee fails to fulfill the terms of the new service agreement.</p><p></p><p>A.  Military Sealift Command (MSC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC) Costs.  Use the space-required rate to compute the MSC transportation cost.  Use the common user tariff rate to compute the AMC transportation cost.  If these rates are not available at the activity OCONUS, they may be obtained from the nearest MSC or AMC traffic officer by submitting a request that contains the travel and transportation dates, terminal points, names of persons concerned, and baggage weight.</p><p></p><p>B.  Commercial Airplane, Train, Bus, or Ship Transportation Costs.  Computation of commercial airplane, train, bus, or ship transportation cost within the CONUS must be based on the Government cost, without tax, for the accommodations in par. 020207.  The civilian employee must be allowed appropriate credit for Government-procured transportation documents or any unused tickets that are returned.</p><p></p><p>C.  Travel Time Compensation.  Travel time compensation is not a travel cost and is not considered in computing liability.</p><p></p><p>D.  Per Diem.  Per diem for travel performed must be considered in computing liability.</p><p></p><p>E.  Civilian Employee Financial Responsibility to the Government.  A civilian employee’s obligation to repay PCS allowances received must be based on travel to or from the first PDS following RAT.  Travel and transportation allowances for subsequent reassignments within the command OCONUS, directed by the employing activity, are not the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>F.  Return Travel Costs</p><p></p><p>1.  Government’s Obligation.  When sufficient travel and transportation allowances exist to cover travel costs for the full distance from the official PDS OCONUS to the actual residence, those allowances are authorized to return the civilian employee to the actual residence.  At that point, the Government’s obligation is fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>2.  Civilian Employee’s Obligation.  When it is determined insufficient travel and transportation allowances exist to cover travel costs for the full distance from the PDS OCONUS to the actual residence, the civilian employee is financially responsible for the costs to the actual residence that are greater than the civilian employee’s allowances.  The civilian employee may provide the transportation and be reimbursed for whatever amount the Government would have paid upon submission of an appropriate voucher and receipts for claimed expenses.  The civilian employee is authorized Government transportation, if available, from the area OCONUS to the port of debarkation, or beyond; however, collections for excess costs should be made before the travel begins, if required by finance regulations.  The civilian employee may be authorized repatriation transportation if he or she has insufficient funds to pay for return HHG shipment expenses, including SIT at the origin, and he or she meets the requirements for repatriation travel.  A Sample Statement of Liability/Credit Violation of Renewal Agreement is available on the DTMO website.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 5:  PERMANENT DUTY TRAVEL (PDT)</p><p></p><p>PART H:  RENEWAL AGREEMENT TRAVEL (RAT) (CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES)</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee, and the civilian employee’s accompanying dependent, may be eligible to receive travel and transportation allowances for returning home between tours of duty OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>0550  RAT LEAVE</p><p></p><p>This Part applies to a civilian employee serving tours of duty OCONUS, including the specific RAT provisions for civilian employee serving tours of duty in Alaska or Hawaii.  A Service’s or DoD Component’s written guidance applies regarding the civilian employee’s leave status while on RAT.  </p><p></p><p>055001.  Eligibility Requirements </p><p></p><p>A.  All Areas OCONUS, Except Alaska and Hawaii.  A civilian employee must meet the requirements in this paragraph to be eligible for RAT.  Before departure from the PDS OCONUS, a civilian employee must have satisfactorily completed the tour of duty (see Tour Lengths and Tours of Duty OCONUS) and have entered into a new written service agreement for another tour of duty at a PDS OCONUS.  The new service agreement covers costs for travel to the civilian employee’s actual residence or alternate location according to this Part and return, and any additional cost paid by the Government due to the civilian employee’s transfer to another PDS OCONUS for the tour immediately after the RAT.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Civilian Employee Stationed in Alaska or Hawaii on September 8, 1982.  A civilian employee serving in Alaska or Hawaii is eligible to receive RAT allowances if on September 8, 1982, any of the following requirements applied and he or she continued to serve consecutive tours of duty within Alaska or Hawaii, as appropriate, within the same state:</p><p></p><p>1.  The civilian employee must have been serving a tour of duty in Alaska or Hawaii.</p><p></p><p>2.  The civilian employee was en route to a PDS in Alaska or Hawaii under a written service agreement to serve a tour of duty.</p><p></p><p>3.  The civilian employee was on RAT and had entered into a new written service agreement to serve another tour of duty in Alaska or Hawaii. </p><p></p><p>C.  Civilian Employee Assigned, Appointed, or Transferred to a Post of duty in Alaska or Hawaii after September 8, 1982</p><p></p><p>1.  The travel and transportation allowances for RAT may not be authorized for a civilian employee assigned, appointed, or transferred to a PDS in Alaska or Hawaii after September 8, 1982, unless the DoD Component determines that payment of these expenses is necessary for recruiting or retaining a civilian employee for that tour of duty and the following apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  RAT is required to fulfill DoD Component staffing needs for mission accomplishment.  This is intended to ensure the availability of a well-qualified civilian employee or a civilian employee with special skills and knowledge who is not otherwise available in the local area and to fill remote area positions.</p><p></p><p>b.  RAT is necessary as a recruiting or retention incentive to fill a particular position in Alaska or Hawaii.  The DoD Component must specify in writing the criteria and guidelines to determine the need for RAT, and must review and re-confirm in writing at least every 5 years the requirement to offer RAT.</p><p></p><p>2.  RAT travel and transportation allowances for recruiting or retention purposes is limited to two round trips beginning within 5 years after the civilian employee first begins any period of consecutive tours of duty in either Alaska or Hawaii.  For example, if the civilian employee arrived in Hawaii on July 1, 2010, and was first given a RAT on July 1, 2013, then the second RAT must begin by June 30, 2015, to qualify within the 5 years.  The civilian employee must be advised in writing of this limitation.  The successive tours must be in the same state.  A tour in Hawaii followed by a tour in Alaska, or vice versa, does not qualify.</p><p></p><p>055002.  Transportation and Per Diem</p><p></p><p>A.  Transportation.  An eligible civilian employee and his or her dependent is authorized transportation, including transportation to and from commercial terminals, from the PDS OCONUS to the civilian employee’s actual residence at the time of assignment to the PDS OCONUS.  Transportation also is authorized from the actual residence to a PDS OCONUS, except for Alaska and Hawaii.  When Alaska and Hawaii are involved, the return must be to a PDS in the same state as the PDS where the civilian employee served immediately before RAT.  POV mileage is not authorized for RAT while on a tour OCONUS (FTR §302-4).  </p><p></p><p>B.  Per Diem.  A civilian employee is authorized per diem during the en route RAT between the PDSs OCONUS and the authorized RAT destination.  No per diem is authorized for the civilian employee’s dependent for RAT when the civilian employee returns to the same PDS OCONUS for duty.  However, when the civilian employee reports to a different PDS OCONUS for duty after RAT, per diem is authorized for a dependent while en route, limited to the constructed time by the usual transportation mode and route directly between the old and new duty locations OCONUS.  AEA may not be authorized or approved for RAT or PCS travel. </p><p></p><p>Note:  There is no dependent per diem, HHG, TQSE, MEA, or real estate allowances in connection with RAT. </p><p></p><p>055003.  RAT Denial or Delay</p><p></p><p>RAT ordinarily is performed between tours of duty OCONUS.  A DODEA teacher cannot be forced to delay RAT.  The time when leave is granted to perform RAT must adhere to appropriate personnel guidance.  The civilian employee’s commander OCONUS may authorize or approve later RAT within a tour of duty if leave is granted according to personnel guidance (B-232179, October 6, 1989).</p><p></p><p>A.  RAT Denial.  RAT at Government expense may not be denied to a civilian employee who has earned it.  However, civilian employees other than DODEA teachers may be denied RAT when the civilian employee meets any of the following conditions:</p><p></p><p>1.  Is being processed for separation.</p><p></p><p>2.  Is going to be involved in a RIF.</p><p>3.  Has a removal action pending.</p><p></p><p>4.  Has been reassigned to a U.S. position.</p><p></p><p>5.  Is to be reassigned to a position in the CONUS in connection with a rotation on a similar program that precludes a required period of service completion under a renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>B.  Delay at Management’s Request.  Management may request a civilian employee to delay RAT by extending the initial tour, or tour then in effect, up to 90 days for good reasons, such as if the civilian employee is engaged on a project that is scheduled for completion within a reasonable time.  Sufficient time must remain in the civilian employee’s renewal-agreement tour following RAT for him or her to serve at least 12 months upon return to the PDS OCONUS.  This is after shortening the length of the renewal-agreement tour by the number of days that the initial tour was extended.</p><p></p><p>C.  Delay at the Civilian Employee’s Request.  A civilian employee may request an extension of the initial tour or the tour then in effect to permit scheduling leave to accommodate personal or job-related reasons acceptable to, and permitted by, the commander concerned OCONUS.  After performing RAT and returning to the PDS OCONUS, the civilian employee’s tour is either 12 months or the length of the renewal-agreement tour for the PDS concerned shortened by the number of days the initial tour was extended, whichever is greater.</p><p></p><p>D.  Limits on Assignments OCONUS.  A delay in performing RAT should not be authorized if the resulting extension to the new tour, or the requirement to serve 12 months following the return to the PDS OCONUS, requires the civilian employee to remain at the PDS OCONUS beyond any 5-year limit, or other limit, on assignments OCONUS contained in personnel guidance.  A delay in RAT may be authorized if the civilian employee is not affected by, or has been released from, the 5-year limit, or other limit, on assignments OCONUS. </p><p></p><p>055004.  Unaccompanied Dependent Travel</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee may travel alone or with a dependent.  A dependent may travel unaccompanied, but cannot perform round-trip travel under renewal-agreement authority if the civilian employee does not, at some point, perform authorized RAT.  An unaccompanied dependent must not be authorized to start RAT beyond 6 months after the date the civilian employee begins travel, except as specified for DODEA teachers.</p><p></p><p>055005.  RAT Non-Cumulative</p><p></p><p>RAT must be used between consecutive periods of continuous employment OCONUS.  RAT may be performed between the completion date of one service agreement and before serving another tour of duty in accordance with a written renewal agreement (35 Comp. Gen. 101 (1955)).  RAT authorization is not cumulative from one period of service to another if it is not used.</p><p></p><p>055006.  Baggage Transportation</p><p></p><p>Travelers should transport minimal baggage with them during RAT.  The maximum baggage allowance that may be authorized at Government expense for a civilian employee and eligible dependents performing RAT is determined by whether the baggage is accompanied or unaccompanied.  The excess accompanied baggage weight allowance for each traveler is 100 pounds gross weight per person.  The 100-pound weight limit does not include free, checkable accompanied baggage.  Unaccompanied baggage is authorized for up to 100 pounds net weight per person and is transported by air, such as postal service and FedEx.  Travelers are authorized either excess accompanied or unaccompanied baggage.  </p><p>055007.  Unaccompanied Baggage of a DODEA Teacher Authorized an Extended Leave of Absence</p><p></p><p>A teacher performing RAT for the purpose of advanced studies at a university in the United States and who is also on approved extended leave, with or without pay, from the current school is authorized transportation of 350 pounds of unaccompanied baggage for each eligible adult and dependent age 12 or older, and 175 pounds of unaccompanied baggage for each dependent under age 12.  Transportation of unaccompanied baggage under this paragraph is in place of the unaccompanied baggage that the civilian employee may be authorized to transport in par. 055006.  Up to 100 pounds of excess accompanied baggage is authorized in addition to that allowed in par. 055006.  </p><p></p><p>055008.  HHG SIT</p><p></p><p>See par. 054307 for HHG SIT while the civilian employee is performing RAT. </p><p></p><p>055009.  Alternate Destination for RAT</p><p></p><p>A civilian employee or dependent is authorized to perform RAT to a destination other than the civilian employee’s actual residence, as long as the RAT destination is in the same country as the actual residence.  Either destination is an official travel destination.  City Pair Program airfares may be used for travel to and from the actual residence, or to and from an alternate destination where the transportation cost is less than or equal to the transportation cost to the actual residence.  If the civilian employee or dependent travels to a more expensive alternate destination, City Pair Program airfares are not authorized for any transportation related to the alternate destination.  RAT reimbursement for travel to an alternate destination is limited to the amount allowed for transportation along a usually traveled route between the PDS and the actual residence.  The civilian employee is financially responsible for all excess costs.  Use the policy-constructed airfare to compute the constructed cost (FTR §301-10 and 62 Comp. Gen. 596 (1983)).  </p><p></p><p>A.  Time and Location Requirement</p><p></p><p>1.  If a civilian employee’s actual residence is in a location in the CONUS, or a non-foreign location OCONUS, he or she and any dependents must spend the majority of the RAT time in the CONUS or that non-foreign location OCONUS for RAT to be authorized.</p><p></p><p>2.  RAT must not be authorized to an alternate destination if the traveler is merely routed through the country of actual residence en route to another country, travels to various points for personal reasons, or is a DoDEA teacher and does not meet the conditions in par. 055011.</p><p></p><p>B.  Administration.  Any alternate destination is determined before travel begins and is stated in the order.  If omitted, the order may be amended later to add the destination, or the alternate destination may be specifically approved on the reimbursement voucher if finance regulations or directives permit.</p><p></p><p>055010.  Limitations</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG.  There is no authority for HHG transportation in connection with RAT except for necessary unaccompanied baggage authorized in this Part.  Signing a renewal agreement for RAT can be the basis for reestablishing expired authority for HHG and dependent transportation to the extent of a prior order that was unused (38 Comp. Gen. 653 (1959)).</p><p></p><p>B.  Unaccompanied Dependent.  See par. 055004 for an unaccompanied dependent’s travel and transportation authority.</p><p></p><p>C.  Duplicate Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  Duplicate transportation is not authorized for individuals who may be separately eligible for RAT as a civilian employee and as a dependent.  In other words, a couple, each with RAT authority, can only travel once.  Each may not travel again as a dependent of the other.</p><p></p><p>2.  When a civilian employee is on a PCS to a FEML area for a 12-month “without dependent” tour and extends service for another consecutive 12-month tour, the civilian employee is eligible for only one type of Government-funded leave, either RAT or FEML, but not both. </p><p></p><p>D.  RAT Combined with Other Travel.  A civilian employee may not be required to combine RAT with any other type of Government-funded leave or travel allowance.</p><p></p><p>055011.  DoD Education Activity (DoDEA) Teacher</p><p></p><p>Under RAT authority, a teacher who satisfactorily completes the period of service in the service agreement is authorized travel to the actual residence in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS during the summer recess.  This travel is authorized whether return under the renewal agreement is to the same or a different area OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>A.  Reassignment at Management’s Request.  Under RAT authority, after completing 1 school-year of service on a current service agreement, any teacher who is reassigned at management’s request from one 2-year area to another 2-year area, may return to the actual residence in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS during the summer vacation.  The normal routing between the two PDSs must be through a location in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS and the teacher must sign a new renewal agreement for the new area of assignment.  Other reassignments at management’s request do not qualify for RAT travel and must be limited to travel by direct routing as a PCS movement between the two PDSs.  The first school year of service at the new location completes the second consecutive school year of required service under the initial service agreement.  Unaccompanied dependent travel is exclusive of any time the teacher is actively enrolled at the college or university in a location in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Attendance at an Accredited College or University</p><p></p><p>1.  When the teacher chooses to return to a location in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS for the summer at the end of the first school year of service, the teacher may be authorized round-trip RAT for education or professional development.  A renewal agreement must be signed before leaving the area OCONUS.  A teacher who returns to the area OCONUS after satisfactorily completing the period of service in the service agreement begins a school-year cycle for a new 2-year period of service under the renewal agreement.  Unaccompanied dependent travel is exclusive of any time the teacher is actively enrolled at the college or university in a location in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.  A teacher must meet one of the following conditions to be authorized round-trip RAT: </p><p></p><p>a.  Be under an agreement to attend an accredited college or university and must present satisfactory evidence of acceptance by, or an acceptable intent to attend, an institution for an appropriate course of study of 6 or more semester hours.</p><p></p><p>b.  Pursue courses for professional preparation or advancement that are related to the present or planned needs of the DoDEA, or pursue other specific professional preparations meeting current DoDEA requirements.</p><p></p><p>c.  Attend courses that are required for continued certification in the teacher’s home state.</p><p></p><p>2.  The teacher becomes financially responsible for previously paid travel costs to attend a course of instruction and the cost was at Government expense to a location in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS when one of the following apply:</p><p></p><p>a.  The teacher cannot provide satisfactory proof of course completion.</p><p></p><p>b.  The teacher has not provided a satisfactory reason for not completing the course.</p><p></p><p>C.  Attendance at an Accredited College or University while on Authorized Extended Leave of Absence.  Round-trip RAT may be authorized for professional growth for a teacher who is authorized a leave of absence to attend an accredited college or university at a location in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.  The teacher must have satisfactorily completed 2 school years in the DoD Overseas Dependents School System and he or she must meet the eligibility requirements for RAT.  The teacher must execute a renewal agreement before departure for the authorized leave of absence.  He or she must present all of the following to the appropriate official responsible for authorizing the extended leave of absence and RAT: </p><p></p><p>1.  Acceptable evidence of intent to attend an accredited college or university to pursue a course of study leading to a higher degree or for graduate work in a chosen field.</p><p></p><p>2.  Evidence that the course of study is not feasible through other means.</p><p></p><p>3.  Proof or acceptance of the course of study.</p><p></p><p>4.  Information regarding successful course completion.</p><p></p><p>D.  Reassignment to a 1-year Tour Area.  A teacher who requests reassignment at the end of the first school year, and receives management approval for reassignment to a new 1-year tour area, is authorized RAT to the actual residence in the CONUS or at a non-foreign location OCONUS for the summer recess.  Personnel guidance applies for pay or leave status.  RAT also is authorized from that actual residence to the new PDS OCONUS indicated in the renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>E.  HHG Storage between School Years.  Authority for storage between school years is in addition to authority for SIT for HHG shipment.  Storage under these two authorities may overlap in time.  Substitute and part-time teachers are ineligible for storage between school years.  Appropriate financial written guidance addresses indebtedness and appropriate notification for collection action.  See par. 054306-C.</p><p></p><p>1.  Administrative Arrangements.  The industrial relations officer or civilian personnel officer with administrative responsibility must notify the Transportation Officer about storage between school years.  The notification must specify the storage period beginning and ending dates.  The Transportation Officer is responsible for storage arrangements and must maintain a record of all storage costs or the reasonable value for storage furnished for each teacher.</p><p></p><p>2.  Consecutive School Terms in Different Locations.  If a teacher is at different locations for consecutive school terms, the losing command or activity pays storage costs until the HHG is removed from storage for transportation to the new PDS.  The gaining command or activity pays for any storage costs after the date the HHG arrives at the new PDS.  Storage may be at either the old PDS or new PDS, whichever location is most practical.  The losing command pays for storage costs only if the HHG is stored at the old PDS.</p><p></p><p>055012.  Dependent Transportation</p><p></p><p>Dependent transportation may be authorized for the civilian employee’s RAT and is subject to the conditions in this paragraph.  The dependent’s transportation cost is limited to the Government’s cost for transportation to the civilian employee’s authorized destination.  A dependent may be authorized RAT only when the civilian employee performs RAT (35 Comp. Gen. 101 (1955)).</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A dependent is authorized round-trip transportation according to the civilian employee’s renewal agreement, provided that the dependent traveled to the PDS OCONUS within the 1- year limit or became a dependent at the area OCONUS by marriage, birth, or adoption before the civilian employee began RAT.  Dependent travel, performed after the civilian employee’s RAT, must be completed within 6 months of the civilian employee’s RAT start date.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  A dependent at the PDS OCONUS may accompany the civilian employee.</p><p></p><p>2.  A dependent may travel before or after the civilian employee, but only after the civilian employee has met RAT eligibility requirements and the renewal agreement is in place.</p><p></p><p>3.  A dependent who did not travel to a PDS OCONUS during the preceding tour, including a new dependent, is authorized one-way transportation to the PDS according to the civilian employee’s renewal agreement.</p><p></p><p>4.  A dependent may be authorized to use RAT to travel to the PDS OCONUS for the first time and may travel at different times than the civilian employee or with the civilian employee on return to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>5.  If the civilian employee’s new tour is at a different PDS OCONUS, a dependent who does not accompany the civilian employee on RAT but remains at the old PDS OCONUS is authorized to travel from the old to the new PDS.</p><p></p><p>6.  The dependent may return to the PDS OCONUS after the leave, if the civilian employee and dependent travel to the actual residence for leave before beginning a new tour OCONUS and the civilian employee is on TDY or attends a training course after the leave but before returning to the PDS OCONUS.</p><p>055013.  Travel and Transportation Funding for RAT</p><p></p><p>A.  Return to the Same PDS OCONUS.  When a civilian employee completes a required service period at an activity OCONUS and executes a renewal agreement for an additional tour of duty at the same activity OCONUS, the activity to which the civilian employee is assigned must pay all travel and transportation costs.</p><p></p><p>B.  Return to a Different PDS OCONUS</p><p></p><p>1.  Losing Activity’s Costs.  Except for a DoDEA civilian employee, when a civilian employee completes a required service period at an activity OCONUS and executes a renewal agreement for an additional tour of duty at a different activity OCONUS, in the same or another DoD Component, the losing activity OCONUS must pay the costs en route to the actual residence or alternate point until return travel begins.</p><p></p><p>2.  Gaining Activity’s Costs.  The gaining activity OCONUS in the same or another DoD Component must pay:</p><p></p><p>a.  Costs en route from the actual residence or alternate point to the new PDS OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>b.  Transportation costs of dependents who did not accompany the civilian employee on the RAT, and the HHG and POV transported directly from the old PDS to the new PDS OCONUS (44 Comp. Gen. 767 (1965)).  </p><p></p><p>c.  All PCS costs when a civilian employee transfers between activities funded by DoDEA.</p><p></p><p>C.  Obtaining a Position while on Leave in the United States.  A civilian employee who returns to the United States under a renewal agreement and arranges a move to a PDS in the United States while on leave is authorized reimbursement for travel and transportation expenses to the new PDS instead of to the actual residence in the service agreement OCONUS.  </p><p></p><p>1.  The losing activity OCONUS must pay the travel and transportation costs to the new PDS, limited to the cost to the actual residence.</p><p></p><p>2.  The gaining activity may pay any additional travel and transportation costs from the actual residence to the new PDS.  If the gaining activity does not authorize a PCS move, the losing activity must amend the order to provide for return from the losing activity to the actual residence for separation.  Travel and transportation expenses for separation are funded according to par. 053713-C.</p><p></p><p>3.  If the Government incurs additional expenses due to RAT performed to the actual residence by the civilian employee or dependent, the civilian employee is responsible for those expenses.  </p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 6:  EVACUATION TRAVEL</p><p></p><p>An evacuation is the authorized or directed departure from an area threatened by unusual or emergency circumstances in the continental United States (CONUS), in a non-foreign location outside the CONUS (OCONUS), or in a foreign location.  The information in this chapter complements the Department of State (DoS) Standardized Regulations (DSSR §600 (Payments during an Ordered/Authorized Departure) and 5 CFR §550.401-409 (Payments during Evacuation).  See Table 6-1 to determine which Agency’s evacuation policy applies in addition to the JTR.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-1.

Tables 6-1 through 6-12 identify who can evacuate a location at Government expense and who may authorize an evacuation, designate a destination, receive payments for an evacuee, terminate evacuation status, and authorize return to the evacuated area.  Further authority for the allowances is in 37 U.S.C. §475a, 5 U.S.C. §5725, and DoDD 3025.14 (Noncombatant Evacuation Operations). </p><p></p><p>060101.  Authority to Order an Evacuation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member’s dependent, a civilian employee, or a civilian employee’s dependent may leave a threatened area at their own expense.  However, the Government authorizes evacuation allowances when one of the individuals or agencies identified in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3 orders or authorizes an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>B.  Cuba Evacuation.  The U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is treated differently than other foreign locations during an evacuation because the DoS is not involved in the decision.  While Guantanamo Bay is a foreign location and OCONUS allowances apply, the USD (P&amp;R) has the authority to evacuate the U.S. Naval Base.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Table 6-2.

Foreign Locations.  The DoS decides when the United States evacuates personnel from a foreign location.  The DoD and DoS agree to share the responsibility in specific situations or locations in Table 6-3.  If the DoS is not present in the affected area or cannot be contacted within a timely manner, then the Combatant Commander (CCDR), the senior commander in the country concerned, or the DoD Attaché is responsible for ordering or authorizing an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-3.

Identifying Evacuees</p><p></p><p>A Service member is placed on a temporary duty (TDY) order or permanent change of station (PCS) order rather than placed in an evacuation status when required to leave a permanent duty station (PDS).  A civilian employee can be evacuated, placed on a TDY order, or reassigned to a new PDS.  Table 6-4 identifies individuals who may be eligible to receive evacuation allowances when the designated Service or Agency in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3 orders or authorizes an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-4.

Choosing an Evacuation Destination</p><p></p><p>The anticipated duration of the evacuation is critical to determining whether a dependent travels to a safe haven or a designated place.  A safe haven is a temporary location to which a dependent is sent.  The safe haven and the evacuated area may be in the same city or country or may be in different cities or countries.  If the conditions causing an evacuation are expected to improve and it is anticipated that the dependent will be able to return to the PDS, then the dependent is evacuated to a safe haven.  A designated place is a location where a dependent will establish a permanent residence.  If conditions are not expected to improve, then the dependent is evacuated to a designated place.  The appropriate official determines whether an evacuee will go to a safe haven or a designated place.</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  The Government may provide evacuation allowances for a Service member’s dependent, civilian employee, or a civilian employee’s dependent when they evacuate to an authorized location selected by the authority in Table 6-2 or Table 6-3.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-5.

Approval from the Secretary Concerned is not required when the evacuation authority in Table 6-2 authorizes a non-foreign location OCONUS as the safe haven.</p><p></p><p>D.  Alternate Safe Haven.  A Service member or civilian employee may request permission for a dependent to evacuate to an alternate safe haven through the process described in Table 6-7. </p><p></p><p>Table 6-7.

See DSSR §614c (Designation of Official Safe Haven; Alternate Safe Haven).</p><p>c.  A DoD Service member or civilian employee must submit the request to the Principal Deputy USD (P&amp;R) with the DoS authorization attached.  The Principal Deputy USD (P&amp;R) may authorize or approve the requests and associated travel and transportation allowances.  A civilian employee’s travel and transportation allowances are effective no earlier than the request date for an alternate foreign safe haven OCONUS.  </p><p>d.

In addition to the authorities listed above terminating an evacuation, safe haven evacuation allowances terminate on the date a Service member detaches or permanently departs from the PDS from which the dependent’s evacuation was ordered or authorized.  However, the evacuation allowances may continue when the PDTATAC issues an Evacuation Allowance Determination to extend safe haven evacuation allowances or the Service member dies. </p><p></p><p>B.  Time Limits.  Safe haven evacuation allowances cannot extend beyond the earliest of the: </p><p></p><p>1.  Established 180-consecutive day period, unless extended by the USD (P&amp;R) for a DoD Service member’s dependent or by the Secretarial Process for a non-DoD Service member’s dependent.</p><p></p><p>2.  Date on which a dependent departs a safe haven for the PDS or designated place, or converts the safe haven to a designated place; </p><p></p><p>3.  Expiration date established by the USD (P&amp;R) or Secretarial Process (as in Table 6-12) for a DoD Service member’s dependent, and by the Secretarial Process for a non-DoD Service member’s dependent.</p><p></p><p>4.

Eligibility for Evacuation Allowances</p><p></p><p>A.  Service Member’s Dependent.  A Service member’s dependent may be eligible for evacuation allowances in accordance with 37 U.S.C. §475a and DoDD 3025.14 (Noncombatant Evacuation Operations).  A dependent must meet one of the criteria in Table 6-13 to qualify for allowances at the location being evacuated, safe haven, or designated place. </p><p></p><p></p><p>B.  RC Member’s Dependent</p><p></p><p>1.  A dependent of an RC member (10 U.S.C. §101 and 10 U.S.C. §10101) on active duty or full-time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. §502(f) may be eligible for evacuation allowances if all of the following occur together:</p><p></p><p>a.  The RC member is on active duty or full-time National Guard duty when the evacuation order is given.  This also applies if the RC member is brought on active duty after an evacuation order is given, provided the eligibility for allowances are still in effect for the location. </p><p></p><p>b.  The dependent actually evacuates from his or her residence or continues to reside at a safe haven.</p><p></p><p>c.  The RC member’s primary residence when called or ordered to active duty or full-time National Guard duty is in the vicinity of a PDS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Evacuation allowances are not authorized for any period in which the RC member is not on active duty or full-time National Guard duty. </p><p></p><p>3.  A dependent of a National Guard member who is released from active duty following deployment from a contingency operation and immediately, without a break in service, is called to full-time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. §502(f), remains eligible for continued evacuation allowances.</p><p></p><p>4.  The dependent of an RC member ordered to active duty under an involuntary authority (10 U.S.C. §12302) in support of a contingency operation and whose order is amended to retain the RC member on active duty under a voluntary authorization (10 U.S.C. §12301(d)) remains eligible for continued evacuation allowances.</p><p></p><p>5.  In addition to the eligibility in this paragraph, the criteria in Table 6-13 also apply.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-13.  Eligibility Criteria for a Dependent to Receive Evacuation Allowances</p><p>CONUS</p><p>OCONUS Locations (Foreign and Non-Foreign) </p><p>and U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba </p><p>1</p><p>a.  A dependent who resides at the Service member’s PDS or in the PDS vicinity when the evacuation is ordered or authorized.</p><p>b.  A dependent who is temporarily absent from the Service member’s PDS in the CONUS or its vicinity.</p><p>c.  A dependent traveling to the Service member’s PDS in the CONUS or its vicinity to establish a permanent residence with the Service member.</p><p>a.  A dependent who resides at the Service member’s permanent duty station (PDS) or in the PDS vicinity when the evacuation is ordered or authorized.  “In the PDS vicinity” means:</p><p>(1)  A dependent is residing in the foreign location or non-foreign location OCONUS within which the PDS is located.</p><p>(2)  A Service member resides with the dependent in an area OCONUS and commutes to the PDS from a place located in an adjacent country. </p><p>b.  A dependent student who would have traveled to the evacuated PDS, but instead travels to a safe haven or designated place.  A dependent temporarily absent from the PDS for any reason after having established residence at or in the vicinity of the PDS, including a dependent student attending an OCONUS dormitory school away from the Service member’s PDS.</p><p>c.  A dependent at, temporarily away, or en route to the Service member’s PDS, who is not command sponsored is authorized transportation only and is not authorized per diem while traveling or safe have allowances.</p><p>2</p><p>a.  A dependent full-time student who is younger than 23 years of age.</p><p>b.  A dependent ordered or authorized to depart the vicinity where he or she lives, travel to an authorized safe haven or designated place and then ordered or authorized to depart that safe haven or designated place location.  </p><p>c.  A dependent who resides at the PDS of a Service member who died before the evacuation was ordered or authorized.  If a Service member dies while a dependent is receiving evacuation allowances, then the dependent continues to receive the allowances as though the Service member had not died.</p><p>d.  A dependent who turned 21 after being moved at Government expense to the PDS in the CONUS and the Service member is still serving at that PDS.</p><p>e.  A dependent who evacuated at Government expense to a safe haven or designated location and turned 21 while there, and the Service member is still serving at the PDS to which assigned at the time the dependent was evacuated.</p><p>f.  A dependent who remained at the former PDS following the Service member’s assignment elsewhere.*  A dependent who moved at Government expense to, or remained at, a former PDS or a PDS that is not the current PDS because the Service member is serving an unaccompanied tour of duty.*  A dependent who was evacuated from his or her residence at that location and turned 21 while at the safe haven or designated place remains a dependent for evacuation purposes and for purposes of return transportation to the location from which evacuated *</p><p>* These dependents are authorized safe haven evacuation allowances, even though no longer command-sponsored.  </p><p></p><p>060202.  Travel and Transportation Allowances</p><p></p><p>The evacuation order includes transportation instructions for departure.  Dependents at the Service member’s PDS OCONUS who are not command sponsored are authorized transportation only.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-14.  Transportation Allowances while Leaving a Location being Evacuated</p><p>CONUS/Non-Foreign Location OCONUS/Foreign</p><p>1</p><p>a.  A dependent directed to go to a safe haven, which instead goes somewhere that is not authorized or approved, is limited to reimbursement for the cost of transportation from the origin to the authorized safe haven location.</p><p>b.  A dependent directed to go to a safe haven, which actually arrives at the safe haven and then leaves for personal reasons, receives no transportation to the personal location.</p><p>c.  A dependent is authorized the same transportation allowances to and from a safe haven as those authorized for a TDY  </p><p>d.  Accompanied baggage is not authorized unless the carrier providing transportation allows excess accompanied baggage and the Transportation Officer in the affected area or the AO authorizes or approves it.  The Transportation Officer and AO are not required to authorize or approve excess accompanied baggage if they believe it is unnecessary.</p><p>e.  An eligible dependent is authorized transportation from the place notified of the evacuation to the safe haven, or designated location, whichever the official determines is appropriate for traveling to the Service member’s PDS when an evacuation is ordered or authorized.  The following criteria must be met: </p><p>1.  A dependent must remain where he or she receives notification of the evacuation to await a decision authorizing onward travel to the PDS, to another safe haven, or to a designated place when the dependent has: </p><p>a.  Official authorization to travel to the PDS on personally procured transportation subject to Government reimbursement.</p><p>b.  Dissolved his or her residence and moved to temporary accommodations pending the travel to the Service member’s PDS.  A dependent who has dissolved the residence is considered to be en route to the Service member’s PDS.  For example, a house is sold and a contract signed with a specified date for moving out and closing the sale of the house or a lease has been terminated and cannot be reinstated.</p><p>2.  A dependent who has not received official authorization to travel to the Service member’s PDS is not authorized transportation or reimbursement for transportation.</p><p>Transportation Allowances Specific to Location Being Evacuated</p><p>CONUS</p><p>Non-Foreign OCONUS and Foreign Locations</p><p>2</p><p>a.  Reimbursement for using a POV is at the TDY mileage rate.</p><p>b.  Reimbursement is to the POV operator; passengers receive no transportation reimbursement.</p><p>a.  A dependent must remain where he or she receives notification of the evacuation to await a decision authorizing onward travel to the PDS, to another safe haven, or to a designated place when the dependent has a port call to the Service member’s PDS.</p><p>b.  The official issuing the port call must consult the Service headquarters to determine the appropriate action to take and provide timely notification to the dependent.</p><p>c.  When a dependent does not have a port call, the Service member’s AO determines the appropriate action to take and furnishes timely notification to the dependent.</p><p>d.  A dependent who has not received a port call or official authorization to travel to the Service member’s PDS is not authorized any transportation under this paragraph.</p><p></p><p>A.  Per Diem while Traveling.  A dependent evacuated from a location in the CONUS or a command-sponsored dependent evacuated from an OCONUS location is authorized the following per diem while traveling:</p><p></p><p>1.  Per diem for travel to and from the safe haven location.  This is paid using the computation method in par. 020301 and adjusted based on the age of the dependent.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-15.  Per Diem while Traveling to and from a Safe Haven</p><p>Dependent’s Age</p><p>Per Diem</p><p>1</p><p>12 Years or Older</p><p>The same per diem as a Service member on a TDY.</p><p>2</p><p>Under 12 Years</p><p>An amount limited to one half of what a Service member traveling on a TDY receives.</p><p></p><p>2.  A dependent at the Service member’s PDS OCONUS who is not command sponsored is not authorized per diem.</p><p></p><p>B.  Dependent Temporarily Absent from PDS.  A dependent, including a dependent student, temporarily absent from the PDS for any reason after having established residence at or in the vicinity of the PDS can receive allowances for only one departure from the location being evacuated during each evacuation.  This includes a dependent student attending a dormitory school in a foreign location away from the Service member’s PDS.</p><p></p><p>1.  The dependent stays at the place where he or she is located when the evacuation is ordered or authorized and is considered to be at a safe haven until instructed otherwise.  The appropriate authority determines whether the dependent will receive allowances to stay at the location, go to another location, or return to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  Safe haven allowances begin on the date the return travel to the PDS would have begun had the return not been prevented by the evacuation.  The dependent or Service member furnishes this date as instructed by the Service or Agency.  The date must not be earlier than the date the evacuation from the PDS actually began. </p><p></p><p>C.  Dependent Student.  The safe haven or designated place replaces the Service member’s PDS as the destination authorized under par. 050816 when a dependent student is attending school in the United States, and the Service member is authorized transportation allowances for the dependent student to travel to the PDS but the PDS has been evacuated.  Evacuation allowances begin on the date the dependent student would have joined the Service member OCONUS had it not been for the evacuation. </p><p></p><p>1.  If the dependent student joins other dependents at the safe haven or designated place, the dependent student is authorized one round trip between the school and the safe haven or designated place.  If the dependent student is the Service member’s only dependent, and if the CONUS is named in the evacuation authorization or order as the safe haven, the dependent student is authorized transportation to and from the exact safe haven location within the CONUS that the dependent student or the Service member selects.</p><p></p><p>2.  The dependent student receives evacuation allowances, in Table 6-17, while at the safe haven.  Transportation to a safe haven has no effect on the dependent student’s travel between the school and the Service member’s PDS OCONUS, as specified in Chapter 5.</p><p></p><p>3.  Unless terminated sooner for other reasons, evacuation allowances continue until the dependent student departs the safe haven to return to school to resume classes there, starts attending classes at a school, or the date the student would have returned to the school under the provisions of par. 050816 from the Service member’s PDS, whichever occurs first.</p><p></p><p>D.  Transportation to Designated Place.  A dependent at the safe haven who is directed to select a designated place and chooses a different location other than the current safe haven is authorized transportation from the safe haven to the designated place. </p><p></p><p>060203.  Escort during Evacuation</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  The AO may authorize an escort for a dependent who cannot travel alone due to age, physical or mental incapacity, or other extraordinary circumstances. </p><p></p><p>B.  Escort Allowances.  An escort may be authorized round-trip transportation, one-way transportation, or transportation to the point from which the dependent must be escorted, as applicable.  The following individuals may serve as an escort: </p><p></p><p>1.  A Service Member.  The escort is issued a TDY order and receives the standard travel and transportation allowances in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>2.  A Civilian Employee.  The escort is authorized the TDY allowances in regulations issued by the civilian employee’s Agency or Department.  A DoD civilian employee serving as an escort must have a TDY order that cites this paragraph as the authority for the travel and must follow the rules in Chapter 2 for transportation.  The Agency directing the travel funds the escort’s travel. </p><p></p><p>3.  A Person Other Than a Service Member or Civilian Employee.  The escort travels on an invitational travel authorization (ITA) and receives the same travel and transportation allowances as a civilian employee on a TDY.</p><p></p><p>060204.  Pet Transportation and Quarantine –Evacuation from Foreign PDS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member is authorized transportation and quarantine fees for up to two household pets (defined as a cat or dog) to and from a safe haven or designated place if he or she currently owns them at the evacuated foreign PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  If the Service member transports the pets at personal expense, then reimbursement is limited to the constructed cost that the Government would have incurred if it had transported the pets.  A Service member traveling on a separation or retirement order is not authorized reimbursement for pet transportation or quarantine fees.  No authority exists to reimburse expenses associated with transporting a pet, including its quarantine, for an evacuation in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>060205.  Allowances While at the Safe Haven</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  See Table 6-13 to determine eligibility for safe haven allowances.  A dependent at the Service member’s PDS OCONUS who is not command sponsored is not authorized safe haven allowances.  </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation</p><p></p><p>Table 6-16.  Transportation Allowances for a Dependent during Evacuation</p><p>Allowance</p><p>Safe Haven or</p><p>Alternate Safe Haven</p><p>Designated Place</p><p>1</p><p>Local Travel</p><p>Yes</p><p>Only if the dependent has not taken delivery of a POV or did not drive a POV to the safe haven.</p><p>2</p><p>POV Shipment</p><p>No</p><p>Yes</p><p>3</p><p>Rental Vehicle</p><p>No</p><p>Only when a POV is scheduled for delivery and arrives late.</p><p></p><p>a.  A local travel allowance of $25 per day for each family, regardless of the number of dependents, is authorized when the dependent has not taken delivery of a POV transported to a designated place or did not drive a POV to the safe haven.  No receipt is required for a local travel allowance.  No local travel allowance is authorized on any day that reimbursement is received for a rental vehicle. </p><p></p><p>b.  Shipment of a POV at Government expense to a safe haven is not authorized.  When a Service member receives a PCS order while a dependent is at a safe haven, the authorization to transport a POV from the safe haven is in the Service member’s PCS order. </p><p></p><p>c.  A dependent directed to go to a safe haven, who instead goes somewhere that is not authorized or approved, is authorized the Standard CONUS rate at the percentage in Table 6-17.</p><p></p><p>2.  Safe Haven Allowances.  An evacuated dependent from the CONUS or a command-sponsored dependent OCONUS is authorized the following safe haven allowances and miscellaneous expenses at the safe haven:</p><p></p><p>a.  Safe haven allowances during the first 30 days while at the safe haven location.  This is paid using the computation method in par. 020301 and the safe haven locality per diem rate, combined with the age of the dependent.  Safe haven evacuation allowances are initially authorized for 30 consecutive days.  The 30-day clock begins on the day after the dependent’s arrival at the safe haven (see par. 020301 for the applicable computation rules). </p><p></p><p>(1)  Each dependent receives the appropriate percentage of the meals and incidental expense (M&amp;IE) rate of the locality per diem rate.  The dependent receives the M&amp;IE regardless of whether there is a lodging expense on a given day.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The amount reimbursed for lodging is the actual lodging cost incurred by the dependent family, up to the maximum available to each dependent at that safe haven.  Individual amounts are based on the lodging portion of the locality per diem rate and Table 6-17.  A dependent receives this allowance for each day in an evacuation travel status.</p><p></p><p>(3)  No lodging reimbursement is authorized if a dependent stays with a friend or relative while at a safe haven, whether or not any lodging payment is made to the friend or relative.  If the dependent rents a house or apartment with a valid, written lease from a friend or relative who does not jointly occupy the rental, then the evacuated dependent is authorized lodging costs in Chapter 2. </p><p></p><p>(4)  If a Value-Added Tax (VAT) relief certificate is used to avoid paying the lodging taxes in an area OCONUS, then the cost of the certificate is a miscellaneous reimbursable expense. </p><p></p><p>(5)  If the dependent moves to a different location other than the current safe haven, then he or she receives the rate authorized in Table 6-17 for the first 30 days. </p><p></p><p>(6)  Tax paid on lodging while at a safe haven or designated place or traveling in CONUS or a non-foreign area OCONUS is a miscellaneous reimbursable expense.</p><p></p><p>(7)  Tax paid on lodging while at a safe haven or designated place or traveling in a foreign area OCONUS is not separately reimbursable.  It is part of the lodging portion of per diem rate used to compute the safe haven allowances.</p><p></p><p>b.  Reimbursement of the expenses incurred for the unexpired lease period up to 30 days if a dependent signs a lease for lodging at the safe haven and is then authorized to return to the PDS or to move to a designated place.  A dependent should avoid signing a long-term lease or a lease without a military clause while at a safe haven.  The amount reimbursed is limited to what the dependent would have received for the lodging portion of the safe haven evacuation allowance for the unexpired lease period.</p><p></p><p>c.  Safe haven allowances are reduced after the initial 30 consecutive days, which may continue for up to an additional 150 consecutive days.  The USD (P&amp;R) can increase the safe haven allowances authorized in Table 6-17, after 30 days for a DoD Service member’s dependent up to 100% of the locality per diem rate and the Secretary concerned can increase the per diem rates for a non-DoD Service member’s dependent.  The 180-day clock starts over at a new safe haven if the dependent is directed to a new safe haven.  If the dependent requests to move from one safe haven to another, then the 180-day clock continues from the previous safe haven.</p><p>(1)  If the reduced safe haven evacuation allowance in Table 6-17 is insufficient to cover the lodging, meals, and incidental expenses for a specific individual at a safe haven, then the dependent or the individual receiving the safe haven evacuation allowances on behalf of the dependent may request an increased rate.</p><p></p><p>(2)  Send requests for an increased rate through the paying finance or disbursing office to the PDTATAC, Chief.</p><p></p><p>(a)  It must contain the actual daily costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and the finance or disbursing officer should add any pertinent information and recommendations.  The PDTATAC contact information for this request is on the front page of this regulation. </p><p></p><p>(b)  If the request is granted, then PDTATAC issues an Evacuation Allowance Determination specifying the amount of a dependent’s evacuation allowances at an authorized or approved safe haven.  The Evacuation Allowance Determination, or the denial of the request, is sent directly to the dependent concerned, with a copy to the finance or disbursing office submitting the request.  PDTATAC provides copies of all requests and approvals or disapprovals to the applicable Service representative.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-17.

Government dining facility availability or use has no effect on the safe haven evacuation allowances for a dependent, even though the dependent uses or may use the dining facility without charge.</p><p></p><p>e.  A dependent who arrives at the safe haven and then leaves for personal reasons receives no transportation to the personal location.  He or she continues to receive safe haven allowances at the same rate as though the dependent had remained at the safe haven, provided that the dependent does not join the Service member to establish a residence or to occupy the old residence at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>f.  A dependent temporarily absent from the Service member’s PDS when an evacuation is ordered or authorized may receive safe haven evacuation allowances based on the locality per diem rate for the location where the dependent is delayed.  The allowance begins at 0001 on the date the dependents would have begun return travel to the PDS.  This date that the dependent would have begun return travel to the PDS must be confirmed from information secured from the Service member or dependents, but must be no earlier than the date the evacuation began. </p><p></p><p>g.  A dependent traveling to the Service member’s PDS when an evacuation is ordered or authorized may receive safe haven evacuation allowances based on the locality per diem rate for the location where the dependent is delayed and using the computation method in par. 020301.</p><p>(1)  The allowance begins at 0001 on the date the dependent receives official notification of port call withdrawal or suspension, or withdrawal of official authority to travel to the Service member’s PDS on personally procured transportation.  The safe haven evacuation allowances continue until 2400 on the date the dependent receives notification to resume travel, or to begin travel to a different safe haven or a designated place.</p><p></p><p>(2)  If travel is authorized directly to the Service member’s PDS, then no safe haven evacuation allowances for travel to the PDS are authorized.</p><p></p><p>(3)  If the dependent moves to a different location other than the current safe haven, then he or she receives the rate authorized in Table 6-17 for the first 30 days.</p><p></p><p>h.  An actual expense allowance (AEA) is not authorized for an evacuation. </p><p></p><p>060206.  Standard Allowances While at Designated Place</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  See Table 6-13 to determine eligibility for safe haven allowances at the designated place.  An eligible dependent directed to select a designated place may choose to convert the current safe haven to the designated place or select a different location.  That is important in determining allowances at the designated place.  A dependent at the Service member’s PDS OCONUS who is not command sponsored is not authorized allowances at a designated place.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation at the Designated Place.  A local travel allowance of $25 per day for each family, regardless of the number of dependents, is authorized when the dependent has not taken delivery of a POV transported to a designated place or did not drive a POV to the safe haven during an evacuation in the CONUS.  No receipt is required for a local travel allowance.  No local travel allowance is authorized on any day that reimbursement is received for a rental vehicle. </p><p></p><p>2.  Per Diem at the Designated Place.  A dependent is authorized the following evacuation and safe haven allowances at the designated place: </p><p></p><p>a.  Once at a designated place, the dependent is authorized safe haven evacuation allowances in Table 6-17 for a limited time to offset lodging and M&amp;IE expenses while finding a house and establishing a permanent residence, limited to Table 6-18.</p><p></p><p>b.  Safe haven evacuation allowances at the designated place begin on the dependent’s arrival date at the designated place, or on the date the safe haven is converted to the designated place.  The direction to relocate to a designated place must specify the date when the dependent’s safe haven evacuation allowances stop.  The termination date of safe haven evacuation allowances is in Table 6-18.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-18.  Terminating Safe Haven Allowances at a Designated Place</p><p>If…</p><p>Then…</p><p>1</p><p>the dependent chooses to convert the safe haven to the designated place and occupies a permanent residence there within 30 days,</p><p>safe haven allowances end at 2400 on the day the dependent occupies the permanent residence.</p><p>2</p><p>the dependent chooses to convert the safe haven to the designated place and does not occupy a permanent residence there within 30 days,</p><p>safe haven allowances end at 2400 hours on the 30th day after the dependent selects the designated place.</p><p>3</p><p>the dependent converts the safe haven to a designated place, and is receiving the reduced rate at a safe haven,</p><p>the reduced rate continues until 2400 hours on the day the dependent occupies a permanent residence or on the 30th day after the dependent selects the designated place.  A Service member or the dependent may request a safe haven allowance rate at a higher percentage through the Secretarial Process on a case-by-case basis when justified by lodging and M&amp;IE costs.</p><p>4</p><p>the dependent chooses a designated place other than the safe haven and is at the designated place for 30 days but does not occupy a permanent residences within 30 days,</p><p>safe haven allowances end at 2400 hours on the 30th day after arrival.  A Service member or the dependent may request a safe haven allowance period longer than 30 days through the Secretarial Process on a case-by-case basis when warranted.</p><p>5</p><p>the dependent chooses a designated place other than the safe haven, occupies a permanent residence, and is there for 30 or fewer days,</p><p>safe haven allowances end at 2400 on the day the dependent occupies the permanent residence.</p><p>6</p><p>the dependent moves to a different location other than the current safe haven,</p><p>he or she receives the rate authorized in Table 6-17, until the dependent occupies a permanent residence or 2400 hours on the 30th day after arrival at the designated place.</p><p></p><p>3.  POV Shipment to the Designated Place </p><p></p><p>a.  When a dependent evacuated from OCONUS goes to a designated place, appropriate authority may authorize or approve the transportation of one POV to the designated place, including any ground transportation required.  The Secretarial Process may determine POV transportation is prudent when a dependent evacuated from the CONUS cannot drive a POV to a designated place. </p><p></p><p>(1)  The POV must be in a port or vehicle processing center awaiting transportation, at the PDS area, or en route to the PDS when the evacuation is declared.</p><p></p><p>(2)  The POV must be owned by the Service member or the evacuated dependent.</p><p></p><p>(3)  When a dependent selects a designated place OCONUS, any taxes resulting from the POV move are the Service member’s or dependent’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>b.  When an authorized POV does not arrive at the designated place by the scheduled delivery date, or is not made available to the dependent on or before the scheduled delivery date, then the Service or Agency must reimburse the Service member for the cost of a rental vehicle for the dependent’s use.  Reimbursement for a rental vehicle is limited to $30 per day with a maximum reimbursement of $210.  The dependent may rent a vehicle as early as the day after the POV’s scheduled delivery date and keep it for up to 7 days, or less if the POV is available for delivery sooner. </p><p></p><p>4.  DLA is authorized when a command-sponsored dependent is evacuated to a designated place.  DLA is also payable when return travel for a command sponsored dependent is authorized from the designated place to the Service member’s PDS.  The prohibition against more than one DLA payment in a fiscal year does not apply when DLA is paid because of an evacuation.  No DLA is payable when a dependent is relocated to a safe haven.  No DLA is payable on behalf of a non-command-sponsored dependent. </p><p></p><p>060207.  Allowances when an Evacuation is Canceled </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A Service member’s dependent who was transported to a safe haven or designated location at Government expense may be eligible for allowances to return to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation</p><p></p><p>a.  A dependent is authorized transportation in Table 6-19.</p><p></p><p>b.  A dependent who turns 21 after evacuating to a safe haven is authorized the allowances in Table 6-19 if he or she was moved to the PDS OCONUS at Government expense and the Service member is still at that PDS.  A dependent who was evacuated while residing at a location other than the Service member’s current PDS because the Service member is on an unaccompanied tour of duty may also receive the allowances in Table 6-19 if he or she turns 21 after the evacuation.</p><p></p><p>2.  Per Diem</p><p></p><p>a.  Safe haven evacuation allowances stop on the day that transportation is first made available to a dependent.  However, the appropriate authority identified in Table 6-12 may authorize an extension of evacuation allowances because of an unavoidable delay that is beyond the dependent’s control.</p><p></p><p>b.  Per diem while traveling from the safe haven to the appropriate destination in Table 6-19 is the same as for leaving the location being evacuated in par. 060202.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-19.

In which case, transportation is authorized only from the dependent’s location at the time travel is authorized to the PDS, limited to what the cost would have been to travel from the safe haven or designated place, whichever applies, to the PDS.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>3.  POV Shipment from the Designated Place</p><p></p><p>a.  When a dependent is at a designated place after being evacuated from an OCONUS location, and the Service member has not received a PCS order, and the dependent is authorized to return to the Service member’s PDS, one POV may be authorized or approved for shipment if both of the following apply:</p><p></p><p>(1)  A POV was transported to the designated place under the evacuation order.</p><p></p><p>(2)  At least 12 months remain on the Service member’s tour of duty after the date on which the POV is delivered to the port or vehicle processing center servicing the PDS, or the Secretarial Process authorizes or approves an exception to that 12-month requirement. </p><p></p><p>b  When a dependent is at a designated place and a POV has been transported to the designated place at Government expense, and the Service member receives a PCS order to a new PDS, the authorization to transport a POV from the designated place is under the Service member’s PCS order. </p><p></p><p>c.  When a dependent is at a designated place after being evacuated from a location in the CONUS, and the dependent is authorized to travel to the Service member’s PDS, a POV may be transported to the PDS in the CONUS, including any overland transportation required, if the Secretarial Process authorized or approves the transportation based on the determination that circumstances make the POV move prudent. </p><p></p><p>060208.  Preparing for Return Trip </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A dependent who was transported to a safe haven or designated place at Government expense may be eligible for return transportation when an evacuation status is canceled.</p><p></p><p>B.

If the air freight allowance is not used to transport unaccompanied baggage because of circumstances beyond the dependent’s control, then the dependent may be authorized or approved an air freight-replacement allowance to purchase necessary items at the safe haven.  The air freight-replacement allowance is in place of an air freight allowance for travel from the PDS.  It is a set dollar amount and is intended to help offset costs of items ordinarily part of the authorized air freight shipment that must be purchased at the safe haven.  When the air freight-replacement allowance is authorized for travel from the PDS, a dependent is still eligible for an air freight allowance upon return to the PDS. </p><p></p><p>(1)  Amounts authorized for an air freight-replacement allowance are:  one evacuated dependent, $250; two evacuated dependents, $450 total (not each dependent); three or more evacuated dependents, $600 total. </p><p></p><p>(2)  No receipts are required. </p><p></p><p>3.

From the designated place or NTS to the Service member’s residence in the PDS OCONUS vicinity, if appropriate, or the Service member may choose to place them in NTS for the remainder of the Service member’s tour OCONUS.  However, HHG may be transported to the PDS OCONUS only if the Service member’s tour of duty is 12 months or more after the HHG scheduled arrival date.  The Secretarial Process may authorize an exception to this 12-month requirement.  </p><p>e.  To NTS for the remainder of the Service member’s tour OCONUS if the HHG cannot be transported to the PDS OCONUS because the Service member has fewer than 12 months remaining at that location.</p><p></p><p>b.  Table 6-22 contains the requirements and allowances for diverting HHG on its way to a PDS when an evacuation is ordered at the PDS.  If the Government is shipping HHG to a PDS where an evacuation is ordered, or if the HHG was turned over to a Government agent for transport, then the Government must make every effort to stop or divert the shipment.  If the Service member personally arranged for the HHG transportation to that PDS, then he or she is responsible for stopping or redirecting the HHG shipment. </p><p></p><p>Table 6-22.

See </p><p>5 CFR §550.401-409 for the evacuation allowances that apply to civilian employees and their dependents during an evacuation from a non-foreign location OCONUS or inside CONUS.  Although DoD has adopted the DSSR and the CFR, some portions of these regulations have been modified to apply specifically to DoD.  The DoD modifications to specific policy are contained in this section.  When the DSSR and the CFR see “Agency Head,” the applicable authority for a DoD civilian employee or the civilian employee’s dependent is through the Secretarial Process, the Secretary of the Service concerned, the Secretary’s designated representative, or the head of a DoD Component.</p><p></p><p>060401.  Travel and Transportation Expenses</p><p></p><p>The en route travel and transportation expenses for a civilian employee or the civilian employee’s dependent who is ordered or authorized to depart the PDS for a safe haven are in Chapter 2.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-23.

Subsistence Expense Allowance or Per Diem</p><p></p><p>A.  Evacuation in a Foreign Location.  The allowances in the DSSR §600 (Payments During an Ordered/Authorized Departure), apply when the evacuation is from a location OCONUS.  The DSSR defines the subsistence expense allowance as the daily amount payable to assist in off-setting the cost of lodging, meals, and incidentals for evacuated civilian employees and their dependents.  The subsistence expense allowance is computed differently, depending upon the type of lodging used, family composition, and certain formulas provided in the DSSR.  For special family compositions not addressed by the DSSR §600, submit requests for computational guidance through the appropriate Civilian Advisory Panel member to the Director, Office of Allowances, ATTN: (A/OPR/ALS), U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC  20522-0104. </p><p></p><p>B.  Evacuation in the CONUS or a Non-Foreign Location OCONUS.  The allowances in 5 CFR §550.401-409 apply when the evacuation is from a location in the CONUS or non-foreign location OCONUS.  When the 5 CFR §550.401-409 cites TDY allowances, or refers to the FTR, the rules in the Chapter 2 apply.  The amount reimbursed for lodging is the actual lodging cost incurred by the dependent family, up to the maximum available to each dependent at that safe haven.  </p><p></p><p>060403.  Shipment of HHG</p><p></p><p>A.  HHG Shipment to Safe Haven.  The shipment of HHG is authorized under the provisions of </p><p>5 U.S.C. §5727 when the evacuation is from a location in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.  Shipment may be authorized from the civilian employee’s PDS to a safe haven pending a determination as to whether the civilian employee or dependent will: </p><p></p><p>1.  Return to the PDS from which evacuated.</p><p></p><p>2.  Transfer or be reassignment to another PDS.</p><p></p><p>3.  Return to his or her actual residence when a civilian employee is serving a prescribed tour for duty at a location OCONUS under a service agreement.</p><p></p><p>B.  HHG Shipment to Next PDS or Actual Residence.  If it is known at the time of the evacuation, or later determined, that the civilian employee or dependents are not to return to the evacuated PDS, transportation for the civilian employee or dependent and HHG may be authorized from the PDS or safe haven to the civilian employee’s next PDS, or actual residence if there is no PCS for a civilian employee serving at a PDS OCONUS under a service agreement. </p><p></p><p>060404.  Subsistence Expense Allowance Rules During Annual Leave, Sick Leave, Home Leave, and Leave Without Pay -- Evacuation OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A DoD civilian employee away from the PDS OCONUS on annual leave, sick leave, home leave, or leave without pay when an evacuation is authorized should immediately contact the PDS for instructions.  The civilian employee then returns to the PDS or receives authority to report to the safe haven or a TDY location.  Dependents may be eligible for a subsistence expense allowance on the day after arrival at the authorized safe haven if the civilian employee has already started official travel to the PDS, TDY location, or safe haven. </p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  The civilian employee and dependents are authorized travel and transportation allowances if instructed to go to a safe haven.  If the civilian employee is away on personal business when an evacuation is authorized, the cost of transportation to the safe haven is limited to what it would cost if traveling from the evacuated PDS to the safe haven.  Upon arrival at the safe haven, payments of a subsistence expense allowance are authorized under the DSSR §600 (Payments During an Ordered/Authorized Departure).  A subsistence expense allowance is not paid to any evacuee authorized to receive per diem.</p><p></p><p>060405.  Emergency POV Storage Due to an Evacuation OCONUS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  If the civilian employee or the employee’s dependent must evacuate the PDS OCONUS, emergency storage of one POV may be authorized if one of the following applies:</p><p></p><p>1.  The POV was transported, or authorized to have been transported, at Government expense to the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  The civilian employee or the employee’s immediate family member drove the POV to the PDS and the POV use was in the Government’s interest.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  POV storage may be at a place determined to be reasonable by the DoD Component concerned, whether the POV is already located at, or being transported to, the PDS. </p><p></p><p>2.  Expenses allowed for emergency storage of a civilian employee’s POV include:</p><p></p><p>a.  Actual POV storage expenses.</p><p></p><p>b.  Readying the POV for storage and then for return to the traveler after the emergency has ended.</p><p></p><p>c.  Local transportation expenses to and from storage.</p><p></p><p>d.  Other necessary expenses relating to POV storage and transportation.</p><p></p><p>3.  The cost of insurance carried on the POV while it is in storage is the civilian employee’s financial responsibility.</p><p></p><p>C.  Advance of Funds.  An advance for transportation and emergency storage of a POV may be paid limited to the estimated expenses amount authorized for that purpose. </p><p></p><p>060406.  POV Shipment </p><p></p><p>A POV may be shipped at Government expense under the rules in Chapter 5 if the proper authority determines that the civilian employee cannot return to the evacuated PDS.  The civilian employee must be given a PCS order to a new PDS or returned to the actual residence following separation from the PDS OCONUS if employed under a service agreement.  There is no other authority to ship a POV in connection with an evacuation.</p><p></p><p>060407.  Pet Transportation and Quarantine –Evacuation from Foreign PDS </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee is authorized transportation and quarantine fees for up to two household pets (defined as a cat or dog) to or from a safe haven or designated place if he or she currently owns them at the evacuated foreign PDS.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances.  If the civilian employee transports the pets at personal expense, then reimbursement is limited to the constructed cost that the Government would have incurred if it had transported the pets.  A civilian employee traveling on a separation order is not authorized reimbursement for pet transportation or quarantine fees.  No authority exists to reimburse expenses associated with transporting a pet, including its quarantine, for an evacuation in the CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS.</p><p></p><p>060408.  Subsistence Expense at the PDS When Home is Uninhabitable</p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility.  A civilian employee who is required to work at the PDS whose home is uninhabitable in connection with the evacuation may be eligible for allowances.</p><p></p><p>B.  Allowances</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee is authorized special allowance for subsistence expenses under 5 CFR §550.405(b)  when he or she returns to the PDS to work.  A dependent who is not allowed to return to the PDS and remains at the safe haven receives safe haven allowances while the civilian employee was required to work at the PDS.</p><p></p><p>2.  A dependent who returns to the PDS with the civilian employee and whose home is uninhabitable in connection with the evacuation may be authorized special allowances under 5 CFR 550.405(b) rather than returning to the uninhabitable home.  Additional guidance is available in OPM’s Handbook On Pay and Leave Benefits For Federal Employees Affected By Severe Weather Emergencies or Other Emergency Situations and the OPM e-mail, “Employee &amp; Dependents Return to PDS But their Residence Uninhabitable,” November, 17, 2005. </p><p></p><p>060409.  POV and Local Transportation – CONUS or Non-foreign OCONUS Evacuation</p><p></p><p>There is no authority to reimburse POV shipment or local travel at the safe haven incurred during an evacuation from CONUS or a non-foreign location OCONUS:</p><p></p><p>060411.  Allowances when an Evacuation is Canceled</p><p></p><p>See the DSSR §600 (Payments During an Ordered/Authorized Departure), and 5 CFR §550.406 and 5 CFR §550.407  for allowances and conditions for a civilian employee’s dependent to return to the PDS when an evacuation is canceled.</p><p></p><p>060412.  Family Visitation Travel (FVT) during an Evacuation </p><p></p><p>A.  Eligibility</p><p></p><p>1.  A civilian employee who is a U.S. citizen assigned to a foreign PDS OCONUS for a tour of duty that lasts more than 1 year may be eligible for FVT if he or she (10 U.S.C. §1599b and 22 U.S.C. §4081):  </p><p></p><p>a.  Has a service agreement that provides for return transportation at Government expense to his or her actual residence.</p><p></p><p>b.

Allowances.  FVT is a discretionary allowance and is not authorized for travel within the country of assignment.  To the maximum extent possible, FVT must be combined with official required travel. </p><p></p><p>1.  Transportation.  The AO determines the authorized transportation mode.  The provisions for transportation in Chapter 2 apply to FVT.  Reimbursement for transportation is limited to the policy-constructed airfare between authorized locations.</p><p></p><p>a.  If a POV is used, the mileage reimbursement is based on the “other mileage rate” in Chapter 2. </p><p></p><p>b.

When travel is by POV, mileage is paid at the TDY mileage rate instead of actual expense, and is limited to the Government-procured transportation cost between authorized locations.  Table 6-26 lists the reimbursable expenses authorized and not authorized during FVT.  Reimbursable transportation costs include the actual ticket cost and those identified in Table 6-26 when not included as part of the ticket cost.</p><p></p><p>Table 6-26.

As we recognized in James H. Perdue, the burden of proof is on the claimant to establish the common law marriage.  See GSBCA 14122-RELO, March 16, 1998 and GSBCA 15207-RELO, May 19, 2000.  State law determines issues of marital status, and the relationship of spouse exists if common law marriage is recognized under the law of the state in which the parties entered into such a marriage.  The following Comptroller General decisions address specific circumstances: B-260688, October 23, 1995; B-247541, June 19, 1992; B-212900, November 15, 1983; B-191316, September 27, 1978; B-191316, April 6, 1978; B-186179, June 30, 1976.</p><p></p><p>4.

Once the civilian employee has submitted evidence in support of the common law marriage, it should be submitted to the appropriate Agency legal counsel for assistance in determining whether or not the putative spouse qualifies as a spouse under the specific state and/or Federal law.

A civilian employee and spouse at an OCONUS PDS assumed temporary custody of two grandchildren.  The grandchildren’s parent was a Service member on active duty with a DoD Service in Iraq.  The Service member (the parent) executed a special military power of attorney granting guardianship of the children to the children’s grandparent.  GSBCA held that the power of attorney did not create a “legal guardianship” as that term is used to define dependent/immediate family members for the purpose of determining eligibility for relocation allowances.  Since the term “legal guardianship” is not defined in the JTR, GSBCA turned to AZ state law (the state in which the power of attorney was executed and in which the Service member resided) for guidance.  Under AZ law legal guardianship can be established only by judicial determination and the powers of attorney provided by the Service member were not sufficient to create guardianship.  Since legal guardianship did not exist, the grandchildren could not be the civilian employee’s immediate family members and the civilian employee was not authorized travel and transportation costs and overseas allowances (TQSA) on their behalf.  See GSBCA 16337-RELO, April 19, 2004.</p><p></p><p>2.  Generally, individuals are the civilian employee’s dependents if they receive at least 51% of their support from the civilian employee/employee&apos;s spouse; however, this percentage of support criterion must not be the decisive factor in all cases.  These individuals also may be dependents for the purpose of this definition if they are members of the civilian employee&apos;s household and, in addition to their own income, receive support (less than 51%) from the civilian employee/employee&apos;s spouse without which they would be unable to maintain a reasonable standard of living.</p><p></p><p>DEPENDENT RESTRICTED TOUR (Service Members)</p><p></p><p>1.

This document is not the authoritative source for travel allowances and readers must reference the applicable JTR chapters and paragraphs to ensure accurate administration and compliance.</p><p></p><p>Reference:</p><p></p><p>DoD Travel Allowance Guidance</p><p></p><p></p><p>DISCLAIMER FOR CHAPTERS 8-10 (ALLOWANCES)</p><p></p><p>Effective 1 October 2018 the chairmanship of the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC) was realigned from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for Military Personnel Policy (MPP) to the Director, DoD Human Resources Activity (DHRA).  Also realigned was the Allowances Branch, responsible policy, technical direction and oversight for the allowances currently published in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR), Chapters 8 – 10.  This responsibility was realigned to the Director, Military Compensation, in the office of DASD (MPP), a component of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. With that, the Allowances regulations will continue to be housed through the JTR, Chapters 8 – 10, until transferred to another Regulation.  Future changes or questions on Allowances policy and rates should be referred to Directorate of Military Compensation Policy.</p><p></p><p>For Chapters 8-10, see https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/JTR_Chapters(8-10).pdf </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></Content>
